"When viewing a psychotic break in retrospect, the point where wholeness fractured is often easy to discern. My homeless odyssey through the community mental health system began, of all places, in a creative writing workshop. 

In May of 2006, I sat in a classroom at the corner of a college tower overlooking the Upper East Side of Manhattan. 

That fading early evening, it was my turn to be critiqued. I had to sit and listen to eleven other students pick apart the first three chapters of my thesis, a novel I had been working on for two years. The reviews on what I thought was my masterpiece were terrible.

“This is the sound of an egomaniac swirling down the toilet of his own narcissism,” said a small, bald classmate. 

Memorable though that line was, another stands out as more telling.

“Based on this character’s experience,” said a man whose day job was serving the city’s unhoused population, “he doesn’t seem to have bipolar disorder as he claims. It feels much more fractured, more schizophrenic than manic.”

The premise of the entire novel was to explore the mindstate of a bipolar recovering alcoholic identical to me, except in name. 

At that time, I was convinced that I was not schizophrenic, even as a close reading of my life story indicated otherwise. Someone with working knowledge of mental health had misdiagnosed me by proxy. I was insulted. To be schizophrenic was to be hopeless. At least the medications for bipolar disorder worked. 

My classmate was condemning me to a living hell. Then another student picked up this thread.

“I cannot comment on this story effectively,” a blond with a mustache said. “My mother lives with schizophrenia. This is too close to me.”

One of my closest peers praised the work, but also said the core of the character seemed to be his delusions, further suggesting that I had gotten myself all wrong.

I had had enough. Still, I had to wait until everyone was done either trashing me or damning my writing with faint praise. 

So, I sat, staring out a window at another tower of the college, trying to ignore the chorus in my head. They were all shouting as I shook slightly from bipolar medication that wasn’t working.

At last, it was my turn for rebuttal, a screed.

“I thank everyone for the constructive criticism given, but, as far as the personal attacks couched as diagnoses, you can all go fuck yourselves.”

In the silence that followed, all I could think was that I had to get away from these haters to finish my novel in the relative quiet beyond New York City. I needed the peace of West Michigan, where my chorus would soften. There, I could hear only the inner life I needed to complete my masterpiece. And it was a masterpiece. No matter what anyone said, I was supremely confident in my craft. 

Once I was confined to psychiatric facilities for months without any release date given, once I heard the Dark Lord who was my inner life’s master, it was easier to recognize this self-assurance for arrogance. 

In graduate school, I had a mentor nurturing my toxic pretensions. The next day, my cell phone lit up. The head of my creative writing program was calling. Certain I was to be castigated, I winced as I answered the call. 

“Mason, I have to tell you, you are the talk of the English Department tonight. We had an annual meeting, and I had words with everyone about your scene.”

I gulped so loudly that he may have heard it on the other end.

“I said your words were the most terrific an artist can find: insight that no criticism can crack, even when that means telling the world to fuck off.”

I laughed, feeling relieved. 

He continued, “Then I made a toast to you, and the whole department raised a glass.”

A few days later, I stood before much of that department to read from my thesis. In another, larger room overlooking the sides of skyscrapers, I read the first chapter that had been derided, certain of its greatness, and loud applause rose from the friends and families of the graduates. 

I was vindicated.

My parents had driven in from Michigan for the reading. The chapter I had chosen to read aloud was cruel to them, mocking my father’s physical abuse and my mother’s blind eye toward it. Still, they cheered along with an enthusiastic crowd. I could feel pride in their pain. 

If I could now speak to the madman-boy smoking with literary award winning heroes on a balcony afterward and looking to crash from on high, he wouldn’t listen to me anyway. He would go back to Michigan again.

The next morning, my parents were bringing me and my belongings back to my hometown. The best opportunity before me was to focus on my manuscript somewhere I didn’t have to work a job until I was done writing. Their first words were that I had to get a job and not focus solely on my novel. It would be rejected within three months by the brand name agent I had been promised by my mentor.

Before that, I wandered in Central Park, chain-smoking Parliaments and reassuring the worried friend beside me that I would be back as soon as I sold my book. 

As I pulled away from my building near the East River, my parents up front, my belongings poking me from behind, it occurred to me that I didn’t know when I would see New York City again, let alone live there - that all my self-regard may be leading me far astray from where I needed to be to succeed. I was headed in the opposite direction that everyone around me thought I should be going except my parents. 

Everyone but my parents was right. 

The fourteen months that followed destroyed me. I lost my mind, relapsed in my sobriety, and banished myself from those parents’ house. A therapist at the time said I was committing suicide in every way I could except for actually killing myself. 

I should have recognized my flight as the first in a series of steps toward self-destruction, but New York felt overwhelming as I stared down my future, no job lined up and no place to stay, that it is still possible for me to understand why I wanted safety so badly.

Later, as the days after that Manhattan workshop clash stretched to weeks, then months, and then a year, I became enmeshed in the thorny tangle of my family and the community around them, and the thorns began to sink in and draw blood. 

I was not safe at all. 

Had I known that I would fashion those thorns into a crown and declare myself the messiah of this world, I may have never reached into them. Initially, I thought I could pluck the blossoms of youthful delusions from the center of a thicket and retract my hand unscathed, but that was just the first in a worsening series of delusions starting with the conviction of my greatness. 

As I look at that tangle now, and it is clear that I meant to ensnare myself the moment I chose to leave New York City. 

I cannot blame my mentor for nurturing delusions about my talent that he believed in as well. 

He only had the insights I permitted about the garden he was fertilizing. Dangerous grandiosity had sprouted and grown in the shadows. There, I cultivated the belief that I was, in fact, a godfigure who would save the world through my exceptional gifts. Everyone who had known my messianic tendencies thought that they had been uprooted, but that complex was still there and soon to be florid again.

In the monologue of these better medicated days, I still hear that moment after I told my MFA program to fuck off, the half-gasps and disgusted quietude, as I lost the plot. 

So I ask for the grace to sing his song, decades on, hoping words may yet ring true in a way that hallucinations never can. 

I know how to treat a messiah complex now. 

I badly want others who believe they are the chosen one to hear me over the characters that haunt them and them alone. 

So, I re-embark on my journey through a system that fails far more often than it heals, knowing that it did heal me, and that it can heal others who harmonize with the voices they most need to hear.

## Chapter 2

In September 2007, I betrayed my sincerest secrets: that I was the Godhead made human to rectify the injustices that Jesus Christ had avoided by founding a religion; that it was my destiny to conquer the Earth by uniting countries in Africa and the Middle East into a superpower; that the only hope for humankind was for me lead a united species on a divinely ordained exodus to Mars. 

These were truths to me. Every time I had shared them, however, I had been hospitalized shortly after that. It was almost always best to lie. I wanted to keep medication doses lower, and the hospital stays shorter, so I told everyone that I no longer believed any of it. But medication, therapy, and support groups couldn’t treat a problem whose existence I denied, and I got sicker without any recourse other than sharing my ridiculous convictions. 

The examination room was separated from the hall by a closed curtain. I lay on a bed inside it, citrus soap and rubbing alcohol wafting through occasional breezes from nowhere that would make the curtain billow. The moving air chilled me through the open back of my hospital gown. Goosebumps tingled my limbs. Sporadically, the demon would break through, and a hand or a leg would spasm before falling still again. 

I had begun to believe that making it through the next hour would mean safety for everyone. I was convinced that September 17 was the day I was supposed to kill my father, and if it ended without bloodshed, I would have staved off a terrible fate. I prayed to myself for the strength to remain catatonic.

“If we make it to midnight,” I said to my family, “everyone will be safe for the time being.”

“Would it kill you to start saying shit that makes some fucking sense?” Chuck asked, apparently unafraid of any violent response arising from me.

Seconds into the tense silence that followed, a nurse appeared with a syringe and asked to inject me with Olanzapine, generally the most effective atypical antipsychotic medication and an expensive one in those years. I took the shot gratefully, its prick seeming to release pressure within me. Over the next minute, the Dark Lord lost his forceful tone, then some volume, then began to mumble, and then was quiet altogether. 

The attending doctor arrived at last. I had been calmed by the injection, but I knew that wouldn’t last. The same day that my psychosis became homicidal, I decided I would tell only the truth until I got the care I needed. Violence was the last line I would not cross, future warfare to subjugate the Western nations and secure resources for a Martian expedition. My madness could go no further toward harming my loved ones. So I had cried for help with a knife in hand, and help felt near enough to be reached at last.

When the physician asked about my problems, I cleared my smoky throat.

“I’m just a writer who recently made a sequence of bad decisions,” I began. 

He cocked a graying eyebrow, perhaps confused.

I told him a jumbled version of the following:

Fourteen months earlier I had finished my Master’s Degree in Fine Arts in New York City and moved back to my hometown. I reconnected with old friends and family friends, all of whom were part of Roosevelt’s tiny folk music scene.  Within a month, I was in a band with Devin, who had gone to school with my younger brother Ty, and I had started an independent record label with Brad, who had gone to school with my older sister Stacy.  Brad and I called our label Houndstooth Records, and we brought in as manager Biff, a former classmate of mine, who was just getting out of the Air Force and wanted to get into the music business.  Brad, at the time, was flush with money from his job in medical device sales, and besides funding Houndstooth, bought a picturesque old house in downtown Roosevelt to serve as our headquarters, a venue for house shows, and hopefully, an artists’ collective.

Devin and I were the only artists for the collective, after another old friend, who had said he wanted to quit his job and become a novelist, chickened out.  We had empty bedrooms to rent and I found two more roommates in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. This pair decided to deal Ecstasy out of the house without informing me. The large one was a Satanist named Redd who claimed to be on the run from the rest of his coven of devil worshippers in Pontiac and had once smoked crack. The small one was a bisexual exotic dancer named Louis who had done every drug he could get his hands on. Louis bought the Ecstasy with money he stole from the tanning salon where he worked. Redd helped sell the Ecstasy, but then spent all the proceeds on crack, which he smoked himself. Louis went after Redd for his share, and there was a fight. 

I talked Redd into moving out to keep the peace. Redd agreed but changed his mind and started calling me to threaten my life and my family’s lives. I confronted Redd in the middle of the road, where he pulled a gun on me. I hugged him and said I loved him and that I was only trying to help him. He told me he had performed a Satanic spell the night before to put a demon in me. I went to the Roosevelt Police, who told me it was not a crime to threaten to kill someone and only asked me questions about the drugs. 

The police raided my house, but I did not return to it. I left town with Devin and a ten-thousand-dollar guitar to sell and start a new life. Devin and I drove all night to New York City. My father called the next morning when I didn’t go to work, and I told him I had moved back to New York. 

My father reported to the police that my car had been stolen so that I would come back home. I agreed to return if he would not prosecute me for stealing the car. Devin and I drove back to Roosevelt. 

Redd kept calling, so I changed my phone number. I began to hear Redd’s demon telling me to kill myself over and over again. I went to the mental hospital and got a new psychiatrist. He put me on max doses of five different antipsychotics, but the demon didn’t go anywhere. 

Frustrated, I relapsed after five years sober so that I would have the courage to commit suicide. Addiction set in instead, keeping me going to seek pleasure, and I ran out of money pursuing it. I got sober again because I couldn’t afford more drugs and booze. 

During another hospitalization, a psychiatrist took me off almost all meds after none made the demon go away. Six weeks later, that very day, the demon had stopped telling me to kill myself and start commanding that I kill other people. It had identified itself as the Dark Lord, the ruler of the material universe whom I was born to defeat. 

The doctor asked if anything had happened to make the voice flip from suicidal to homicidal.

“I just realized again I was the Messiah, and then it just switched,” I said. “I want to be clear right now. I don’t want to kill anyone. I’m hearing a voice telling me to kill. I fought it. If I hadn’t, there would be dead bodies. I’m safe.”

“Well, who is this voice telling you to kill?”

I motioned him to approach me and rose to lean forward off my bed. He showed no sign of being concerned that I might hurt him, which I considered foolhardy. In general, I had been unimpressed by the security precautions taken to prevent me from murder. I was personally offended that they didn’t take my command hallucinations more seriously. 

“Grab that scalpel you see and rip open this doctor’s neck,” the Dark Lord said to me then.

I knew that particular push to murder someone wouldn’t outlast the examination, so I reported one that I was afraid would not pass so easily. There, with him close to me, hearing orders to stab, I asked him what seemed like a reasonable request? “Can you keep it between us? I don’t want to hurt anybody.” 

He nodded. I knew what duty to warn meant. If I was a threat, he had to record it. My question was a test to see if he would lie to me. He was lying.

“The Dark Lord is commanding that I kill my father,” I whispered to him anyway, inches from his face.

He asked if I had a plan to do so. 

“Just now,” I said, leaning away from the doctor, “I had a steak knife, and I was going to stab my father in the face.”

“I thought you said you didn’t want to kill him?”

“I meant the voice suggested a steak knife. You should know that by now. It’s a crucial distinction. I contract for safety. I’m just scared of my thoughts.”

Chuck had always told me that when I was drunk, even stumbling stupid drunk, I never slurred my speech. My words always sounded clear and together, even if the thinking behind them was dulled. I have always been that way with my madness. I can be in a shitstorm of hallucinations and patiently describe each one to a therapist before the storm even clears. 

This rarely bothers mental health professionals. I am seen as having insight. Sometimes insight sounds more disturbing than a lack of it because it makes everything seem like an act. This doctor had no doubt that I was dangerous, acting or not. 

There was no question as to whether or not I would be admitted somewhere. A gatekeeper from Roosevelt Community Mental Health, where I had received treatment, approved my admittance without friction after only two questions: “Are you a danger to yourself? Are you a danger to others?”

But I sensed in the doctor something different than I’d ever felt in past hospitalizations. This was the first time homicidal ideation was my presenting problem. The sympathy that had been in the eyes of those treating me while I was suicidal was gone now. Almost every emotion altogether was hidden on the faces of my care providers. There was only fear there, fear I had never sensed before. 

I was a large man, I had urges to kill, I claimed to be possessed by a demon, and I was twitching and even blurting out curse words because the demon had a great deal of power. I was nothing like the young man who’d once come into a ward to deal with suicidal feelings from some sick romance. No, I had the potential to be a monster as evil as the one within me claimed it was. 

I saw my brother and father briefly before I walked off with a worker toward the behavioral health ward. My father gave me a nod and a surprisingly gentle smile. Chuck just stood there, stoic and blank. Dr. Dennis told me he loved me, and I responded in kind. The twitches calmed as I had to collect myself to walk a long distance, but the darkness had already fallen into place within my mind, its armies of mad thoughts poised to battle with the forces of good within me. 

The ridiculous adventure through the machinations of public health and welfare systems following that examination was, in part, a result of its time. In the years before the Affordable Care Act, it was impossible for my parents to throw enough money at my problems because there was no way whatsoever for me to buy my own health insurance with a preexisting mental health condition. As long as I was supported by them, I would have no health insurance. Unless I was destitute enough and independent enough for Medicaid, there was no hope for me to pay for the care I needed. Even with a physician for a father, we couldn’t afford more than one kind of medication - they cost thousands a month. 

The very structure of American society itself in 2007 had condemned me to be a psychotic wreck trying to conquer the world through a cult and lead humankind to Mars. I was helplessly furious for many good reasons.

## Chapter 3

My admission ended late. By the time I got to my bed, there were only four hours until the next day began. I was awakened by a mental health worker before six AM. She lumbered in, poked my arm to fill vials of blood, and left in a ruckus. 

I didn’t dare go back to sleep. In Michigan in 2007, smoking was still permitted on the grounds of the Roosevelt Behavioral Health Unit, but only during four periods throughout the day. I already knew that the first was at seven-thirty AM. If you missed the dawn session, you were down to only three breaks. 

I’ve always loved mornings, even bad ones. Already I was so worked up that I felt ready to burn through the world. I floated into the smoking room on fire. 

The smoking room was small, with a line of chairs along all four of its walls broken only by the doorway. Above the chairs on all sides were windows hatched with a metal lattice to keep us safe. The floor was scrubbed every night but was still stained with ash. The air smelled like a cleaning lady with a two-pack a day habit. 

Everyone was seated too close together unless you were sitting next to a pretty woman, which I was. The rest of the crew were not the kind you wanted to bump knees with, however.  But knees bumped together anyway, and the words flowed into the spaces between drags. In smoking groups, words tend to flow no matter where you are. That room was the only place in the Unit where I felt I could talk freely. I leaned toward the overfull ashtray on the center table and collided hands with the pretty woman.

“Why are you here?” she asked me. In a mental hospital, this isn’t just an existential question. It is the best way to start polite conversation with an unfamiliar patient. The standards for politeness inside a behavioral health unit smoking room skew far more personal than those outside of one.

By age twenty-six, I had been in a unit several times prior and was comfortable saying just about anything within one, for better or worse. Before I went into that, however, I promised myself, for the first time, that I would be honest with others until I got the help I needed. No more hiding what I really believed to get released. 

“I’m here because I’m God,” I said. “What’s your name?”

“Carrie,” she said.

“Mason,” I said, and we gently shook hands.

When I revealed my secret identity, one nervous man pushed all the air out of himself at once through puckered lips, making a whooshing noise, like a sound effect on an old radio show. He had no hair to run his hand through but did so anyway. Then he ground his butt into the ashtray and climbed over scrunched knees to flee the cramped room. 

The rest of the patients there seemed more impressed than disturbed. “I knew you would come,” a wrinkled blonde said with gravel in her throat.

“For real?” Carrie asked. Her mouth puckered in anticipation. Then her tongue bobbed and twisted the wedding-sized ring piercing her lower lip. Just before I answered, she opened and then popped her jaw.

 “I’m afraid so,” I said. “I’ve come back to the world to save it from itself.”

One man was fingering the golden cross around his neck. He started to speak, then stopped himself. Carrie cracked the knuckles on her short, thin fingers. 

The man with the cross found the strength to speak. “There is Christ inside us all. You mean that?”

“No. No, I don’t. I mean I am God, the Father, in the flesh.”

Abrupt laughter peeled through the room then stopped. I looked to my right and studied the man who was laughing. He had on comically large glasses. That wasn’t the only comic aspect to his personality. Everything about him glowed with humor. “Oh, Shit,” he said, “We’re in trouble now.”

The way he laughed at himself, you couldn’t help but laugh along. What began as something like a nervous reaction spread through the group, and soon the whole room was roaring.

When the joy died down, I said, “But, seriously, I am God.” Then the laughter began all over again. 

The man with the cross bowed his head in silent prayer, a little filtered cigar hanging from his lips as he could not hold it in folded hands. He raised his eyes to me and looked into me as no one ever had before. “I’ve prayed to God,” he said, “and he told me you are Him.”

I nodded. The room became very quiet.

A woman across from me wasn’t as convinced as that first witness. “If you’re God, prove it,” she said.

Rather than insist that faith without proof is not faith, I took her up on the challenge. I’m not sure if I remember this correctly, as it seems unrealistic, but in my memories, the times that I performed supernatural feats are as real as any of the roommates I had. They existed as far as I know. That woman was my first display of power. I would have been better off had it been my last.

“You were born at seven-thirty-three AM in Wisperia to a school teacher mother and a veteran father twenty-one years her senior. Your first memory is of falling off a tricycle in the middle of a busy street. You resent it when people ask what your favorite color is because it is pink, and you think that makes you sound too girlish. You are not girlish. You played softball like a baseball star and lost a scholarship because of a breakdown. This is your third trip to the hospital in your life, and right now, you are thinking about giving me a tulip for no particular reason. Shall I continue?” She shook and closed her wide eyes.

“He was right?” asked the jokester in glasses.

“You are God,” Carrie said.

“Don’t look into my head next time I’m in the shower,” the jokester said to more laughter. 

I asked his name.

“You know it’s JD. They call me JD.” He said he tried to kill himself by lighting a small fire in a garbage can and sticking his head into the smoke with a towel over it. It was a strange way to attempt suicide, and had he told the story with his usual verve, it could have been funny, but there was suddenly a density to his dark eyes, a concentrated emptiness while looking through me as if I were a ghost whose translucence was slightly obscuring something worth seeing, perhaps a naked woman or the bottom of a movie screen. I was chilled by this darkness.

The man with the cross stood and said, “I must now go and write hymns in praise of you.” Then he bowed his head again before disappearing from the room. 

“I believe in you, too,” Carrie said. “First God worth believing in.” 

An older man who looked as though he could have played running back for Grambling in the nineteen-forties appeared in the door, a mental health worker named Lincoln. He tapped his watch, showing that it was time to leave. I had managed to smoke two cigarettes. That was going to have to be enough.

I went into the main room of the Unit. It was almost as long as the whole place, with a dining area at one end and a lounge at the other. There was no separation between the two. 

I found a plastic tray covered with fatty breakfast foods that seemed out of place in a hospital. Carrie sat across from me and found bacon lying across her whole entrée. “I’m a fucking vegetarian,” she snapped. “Guess I’m on a diet today.”

I smiled weakly but couldn’t really let myself feel much for fear of losing control. The Dark Lord was coming to life within me. I could sense his power growing upward like a vine choking a tree, a slow snake. Still, I held it together, twitching to keep him from forcing himself through my body. 

Carrie didn’t know me well enough yet to understand how serious my problem was, and perhaps even thought that I didn’t belong in a hospital at all. 

“You know why I’m here,” she stated flatly.

“No,” I said, “no, I can’t do it all the time or at will. If I’m confronted by a doubter, the Spirit just speaks through me.  It’s hard to explain. You’ve been in some situation where you said something that surprised you? Something you hadn't meant to say but came out anyway?”

“I’ve said, ‘Yes,’ like that,” she said. “To sex and to drugs.”

“Well, think what it would be like to say, ‘Yes’ a few hundred times, with each of those strange feelings piling up on each other. It’s like that. But, anyway, tell me about yourself.”

“I’m nineteen. I’m addicted to hydrocodone. They’re waiting for a bed at a rehab to open up. I know why you’re really here.” 

“Tell me, and I’ll tell you if you’re right.

She popped her jaw. Then: “You’re here to learn how to control your powers so you can save the world.”

I smiled. There was a sense of optimism in Carrie that hadn’t been there when she had walked into the smoking room. I had only known her for about an hour. I could read her already, but the voice that knows everything wasn’t flowing through me. I was glad about that. It makes for awkward conversations.

Carrie and I finished our trays and moved over to a couch. She rested the red of her head on my shoulder and breathed deep and even. “Breathe with me, Mason,” she said. “It helps. Breathing always helps.” There was a serenity to that moment where the good and evil speaking to me signed a ceasefire, quiet on the front for a few minutes of serenity.

JD sat across from us and just smiled, showing broad whiteness surrounded by black beard and brown skin. I heard a voice begin to sing. It was the man with the cross. He had a Gideon Bible in hand and was pacing in front of the nurses' station, incanting very poorly. What words I could understand concerned the risen savior and the singer’s joy that salvation was near. 

This singing would continue far too long. Hours into days, days into weeks, he sang of my holiness, and it only got more annoying. Religious delusions can take on a life of their own with minimal prompting. What I had begun would only spread.

This reverie ended with an order barked at a high pitch. “You two! No touching!” said a woman in scrubs shaped like a teddy bear with a Barbie head. 

Carrie raised her head from my shoulder and glared at the teddy Barbie. “For real?” she asked. We pulled away but gazed warmly at each other. 

Then I felt myself shake the woman beside me, shuddering at an awful thought. Was the voice that told me I was God also what kept commanding me to kill people?

## Chapter 4

My new therapist, Joyce Carter, was a lovely, stiff woman with short blond hair. She favored pantsuits. Her trim form moved with rigid grace, like a robotic arm on an assembly line. I first saw her the morning I met Carrie and the rest of the patients. 

Shortly after that first smoke break, we patients were gathered into the main room. The schedule for the day’s groups and activities was read aloud, a few formalities were covered, and we were left on our own for a short while.

Only a moment into this repose, Joyce approached me. I thought perhaps she would chide me for letting Carrie put her head back on my shoulder. She had the bearing of a schoolteacher about to chastise someone. 

To my short-lived relief, she told me she only wanted to do an intake interview in her office. I rose and followed her. From behind me, I heard a voice call my name. When I snapped back my neck to check, however, no one looked at me. Then I heard a hushed man’s voice in front of me. The Dark Lord was returning.

Joyce’s office came right off the main room, so it was a short stroll to get there. She made no attempts to break the ice. 

From the start, I got the impression that she wanted to be an instructor rather than a counselor. On her door, her title said she only had a master’s degree in psychology. I doubted she had much to teach me.  Even if she did, I wasn’t there for lessons. I was in the hospital to deal with the Dark Lord.

“Listen,” I said to start, “I want to make one thing clear. I know psychology and psychiatry. I’ve read the DSM-IV more than once, studied Kaplan and Sadock, both volumes, as well as Jamison’s definitive text on Bipolar Disorder, and Freud and Jung and James and the other pioneers. I don’t say this to brag. I say it to tell you that if I wanted to, I could easily convince you that there was nothing wrong with me.”

“Now, Mason, don’t you think that’s grandiose? I’ve been doing this for twenty-two years.”

She didn’t look fifty until I knew she was fifty. There were hairline wrinkles throughout her neck, and she could not hide the aging on her hands either.

“Let me finish,” I growled. I was surprised at this growl in my voice. I sounded like someone else altogether. “I tell you this not to brag but to reassure you. I am not going to try and fool you like I have every other doctor who’s treated me. I don’t want to get out soon. I want to get better.”

“That’s fine, Mason, but I don’t appreciate your attitude.” Again, she gave me a gesture that reminded me of my awful second-grade teacher – Joyce bobbed her head quickly as if to say, “So there.” Then she asked what the problem was. 

I told her that I was hearing a voice that was telling me to murder people, specifically my parents, my therapist, and my psychiatrist. 

“So, how do you want to kill these people?” she asked.

“Wait,” I said, annoyed. “I am being told to kill them, but I don’t want to. If I wanted to, I wouldn’t be here. They’d be dead, or I would have been killed trying to kill them.”

“The attending in the ER told us you were particularly interested in murdering your father,” she said, still not acknowledging my distinction.

“Come on,” I said. “Isn’t your hearing a bit selective to work as a therapist?”

“Mason, you’re not hallucinating. You know you are hallucinating, so you can’t be hallucinating.”

“This is bullshit,” I said, shifting in my pink chair. I looked at the pictures of Joyce’s two dimpled boys on the wall and pitied them.

“I don’t appreciate your language or your tone,” she said softly.

“Don’t you see that old catch-22? If I know I’m crazy, I’m not crazy? Either way, I’m still crazy.”

“First of all, I don’t know what catch-22 means, and second, we don’t like the word crazy around here.”

“Now you’re using the royal we? Or are you just speaking for everyone and assuming they all agree with you?”

“You said you wanted to get better. You have to tell me what you want to do first. How would you kill them if you could?”

“Last night, the Dark Lord was saying to take a steak knife and stab my dad in the face over and over and over again until he had no face left.”

“I’m going to put out a duty to warn against you. You are not allowed to see your parents or your previous treatment team, and you are barred from being at your parent’s house.”

“Why?” I asked. The anger had waned, and I was pleading. “I told the ER that I was safe. I’m not going to do anything. I just want help.”

“These orders will help you in the end.”

“You really don’t know what a catch-22 is?”

“No, I haven’t seen that movie. Is it good?”

“The movie sucks, but the book is great.”

“I don’t have time to chat about books. Tell me about your voice.”

“He calls himself the Dark Lord, claims to be as old as man, and from Sumer, an ancient city.” I thought about her ignorance and made sure to explain details. “From what I gather, he is bent on destroying me. To do so, he’s lashing out at my entire support system.”

“Can I talk to this voice?”

I shuddered. My jaw dropped. It stayed open and silent for a chilling pause. Then: “You don’t want to do that.”

“This whole relationship is going to work much better if you give me the benefit of the doubt, Mason. I need to find out what’s going on. Let me hear the voice.”

I convulsed. I shook and jerked and twisted my body violently enough to tip the chair and nearly knock it over. The shaking stopped, and I found myself in a strange place. I felt like it feels to watch a movie shot directly from a character’s point of view. I had no control over what I was experiencing.,

“Why do you want to destroy Mason?” she asked. There was a smirk on her intensely pink lips. From my remote view of the action, I groaned, embarrassed that she was so dismissive of something so dangerous.

“I want to destroy us all.”

“And why do you want to do that?”

“Have you ever tasted someone else’s blood?” the Dark Lord asked.

“No,” she said, taken aback.

“Well, I know you’ve tasted cum. It’s a lot like that.”

“Mason, you’re lucky I have so much respect for your dad. One more remark like that and you’re in terrible trouble.”

“I’m not Mason,” he said.

“Oh, right.” She rolled her eyes. As she straightened her suit coat, the part of me that was still untouched by the monster began to pray that it didn’t get any worse. 

“I only said the blood thing to remind you that you are Catholic. And as such, you must have some idea that they do still perform exorcisms. If you want Mason back, you better call a priest.”

“Why are you so important that the demon chose you out of everyone?”

“Mason is God,” he said.

Joyce sighed and pulled out a clipboard. After she scrawled something on it quickly and loudly, she put away the pen.

“Why would you allow ballpoint pens in here? They make weapons, you know.”

“I’ve had about enough of this. It is going to be my recommendation that you receive a continuing order of treatment. You are going to have to stay in Agawatta County for a year. During that year, you will comply with all your treatment requirements, or you will be hospitalized. If you leave the county and are stopped by the police, you will be hospitalized. A judge will make sure of it. Can I have Mason back?”

My body seized, and then slackened. The point-of-view movie was over.

“I just have one question.” 

I nodded.

“Do you think you are the second coming of Jesus?”

“No,” I said and stood. Joyce stood and reached out a hand to shake mine. As I took hers in both my hands, I clarified my position. “I am not the second coming. I am God the Father, come to Earth to save humankind from itself.”

Joyce let go, and for the first time, I saw what I thought was sadness on her face. It seemed as though it was only upon learning about my messiah complex that she understood how sick I was. 

She might have even believed that I believed that the Dark Lord was real. I knew it was an illness. At least a part of me did, but I no longer believe she knew that I knew that. When Joyce’s door softly closed behind her, I came closer to understanding just how much trouble I was in. 

If I couldn’t go to my parents, there were few places left to go. My world was already falling away. Deep inside, I heard the Dark Lord laugh, and it echoed as if I had enough space in myself to carry the world.

## Chapter 5

I didn’t go to groups my first morning in the Behavioral Health Unit. I stayed in my room to write. I had work to do if I were to deliver us from evil. 

I was drafting a new testament for Christians about myself instead of Jesus. I earnestly believed that if I wrote the right book, my witness would demonstrate to readers that I was God. Eleven months into a psychotic episode, I kept chasing, in tortured retrospective, the wonderful memories of a lost life in Lower Manhattan, and was simultaneously pursued by the Sumerian demon planted inside me, whose hunting call was a list of names to kill. 

I set down the legal pad that was already dogeared after only one morning of work. An office-like feel made my room seem appropriate for furious labor. After an hour, I had penned about ten pages of a tract that was convincing me I was, in fact, God himself. There was much more to write if my story were to convince anyone else. 

I had been too preoccupied to put away my clothes. The surfaces felt dusty even though I knew they had been cleaned recently. In the Unit, only smears of color through the frosted windows hinted at the exterior. I wondered what I would see if I could see out the window. Somehow, translucence without transparency felt symbolic after my visit with a new therapist named Joyce Carter. I told her the truth, and now my clothes would be here for a while.

I jolted in my chair when Lincoln knocked on my open door with giant knuckles. In his deep rumble of a drawl, he told me it was time. My new temporary psychiatrist was ready to meet me. Lincoln led me around a few corners, and then I was in the old man’s office.

I had heard from my father about Dr. James Wynne, an Irishman who had graduated from Oxford University Medical School and worked in England for decades. Just before I saw him, I wondered why a man who had these credentials would choose to live in Roosevelt. 

Dr. Wynne looked eighty, though this full-time job made that apparent age unlikely. Then it passed through my mind that his quiet life at the Behavioral Health Unit might well have been some sort of retirement, and Roosevelt, with its sandy beaches, a cheaper Florida. 

Dr. Wynne spoke with an Oxbridge accent that felt deliberate, much like the only other such alum I’d known, a Russian national and professor who’d taught me Chekhov at the University of Michigan. 

After brief formalities, he began to prod me. “Ms. Carter tells me you’ve read Kaplan and Sadock?”

“I’m surprised she can remember a sentence’s worth of information. She’s never read Catch-22. Didn’t even know what one was.”

I looked at eight shelves of books rising behind Dr. Wynne. I recognized many names on the spines. He had original texts by dozens of psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists, and neuroscientists – Kraepelin, Beck, Erickson, Skinner, Piaget, Damasio, Sacks – every such doctor I could think of and many other names that I didn’t recognize. At the end of the lowest shelf and easily within reach was the two-volume definitive textbook Dr. Wynne had mentioned, Kaplan and Sadock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry.

 “That’s a good book to know. I had just started practicing when it was published.”

“Catch-22?” I asked.

Dr. Wynne smiled briefly with only his mouth. Meanwhile, the remainder of his motionless face informed me that I was being humored. It was clear there was an Irish accent underneath his proper one that he struggled at times to conceal. He was an outstanding actor who had been miscast in a part that he could not quite play right. “If you’ve read Kaplan and Sadock, you know that I can’t very well treat you for bipolar disorder.”

 “So, you’re saying I’m cured?”

“Mr. Dennis, your joking is not appreciated. I do not think you yet have a proper understanding of how grave your situation is.” Dr. Wynne pushed up the cuffs of his houndstooth blazer, running one hand over a suede patch on his sleeve as if to confirm that it was still there.

“Joyce said I couldn’t stay with family after this, which I guess makes me homeless. Are there other minor concerns like that for me to be very serious about?”

Dr. Wynne removed his aviator glasses and pinched the bridge of his Roman nose. “I can only help you if you are sincere. I need to know about you, not about your sense of humor.”

“What’s this nonsense about me not being bipolar?”

“Bipolar people don’t hear voices telling them whom to attack, Mason. You have been treated for something you didn’t have. Treated wrongly for years. I’m sorry you had to go through that.”

The gallows humor died right there. I sat up in my chair, as alert as a child who’d been whacked with a ruler while napping in class. “So, you’re telling me you’re right, and every other doctor I’ve ever had has been wrong?”

“I have a great deal of respect for your father as a fellow physician, Mason. I believe he’s a priceless asset to this community, especially because of the front-line work he does to refer people with mental health conditions to the right places. But to you, he has done a great disservice. He biased estimations of your ailment until they were no longer accurate, though they remained precise. Over and over, you have been told you had what your father thought you had. Are you beginning to understand why you are so angry at him?”

“You imply that I’ve known I was misdiagnosed, and that my rage is simply a consequence of that?”

Dr. Wynne let out a long, condescending sigh. “I don’t believe there is much wrong with your cognition, only with the environment that produced it. You have some difficult existential issues to resolve while you are here. In this safe setting, I expect you’ll resolve them. I’m recommending no increases to your medication.”

“Are you out of your mind?” I asked sincerely. “I’m on almost nothing.”

“You will need all your wits about you to make peace in the battle within yourself. I wish you the best in that good fight.”

“You’re leaving me on a battlefield naked,” I said.

“A clever image, Mason, but far from a fair one. We need to figure out what is wrong with you before we can treat you for anything. I cannot discern that if I change the way you are right away with medication. If you were anyone else…”

“If you’re going to refer to my father again, you can save it.”

“You probably knew you would be getting special treatment here. You are. That might mean a long stay, however. I want to observe you right where you are at, keep you the same so I can see what is wrong with you rather than merely guess. It will not be easy for you. I will be seeing you often to support you through this trying time.”

I looked at him then and saw flowing from him the avuncular affection one often sees on the face of a doctor. For the first time since we’d met, I felt confident that the doctor’s plan made sense. If everyone who had treated me up to that point had been right, why was I still having such difficulties? The more I thought about it (and I was thinking fast then), the more I felt a sense of hope.

It lasted as long as a feather remains still in a cyclone. Joyce Carter was the wind that snatched it away. She did so by doing little more than entering the room. As soon as she popped into Dr. Wynne’s office, the whole dynamic of our interaction changed. I sensed a sort of power flowing from her and over him.

“Something wicked this way comes,” I said and winked at the doctor. “You wash the blood off your hands yet, lady?”

Dr. Wynne clearly recognized the references and what I was implying. Already I could tell that he seemed to be controlled by a woman who did him no good.

‘You’re not going to get anywhere talking nonsense,” she said.

“Ms. Carter told me that you have been claiming to be the Messiah.”

“Well, aren’t you a portrait of Portia and her flesh pound?” I asked Joyce. The game had begun. I started talking in literary references as often as I could around the two of them. He got them. She didn’t.

Their inappropriate relationship was already clear to me. There was no way a scholar like Dr. Wynne would let an arrogant, obtuse woman change his entire manner if they weren’t fucking.

“John, I again ask you to temper your humor,” Dr. Wynne said.

“It’s not my fault that I was born to set right these out of joint times.”

“Enough with the riddles!” Joyce all but shouted. She reshaped her short hair with both of her hands, huffed in annoyance, and shifted in her chair. I had clearly hit a sore spot with this woman. She did not like not understanding what was going on, and I was purposely confusing her. As a silence stretched, she only looked more uneasy.

Disturbed by her disturbance, as only a lover could be, Dr. Wynne took on a whole different bearing. He rose upright in his squeaky chair and looked into my eyes as if he were a hypnotist who could put me in my place with a mere flash of his will.

“Tell us, why on earth do you believe you could ever be a messiah?”

“You have yet to see my powers. I possess a sort of creative omnipotence. Any kind of art I excel at. It is through this art that I will save the world. I will change it as greats have changed it in the past, and my changes will come as we pivot again on a turning point and head a new way.”

“So, art makes you the reborn son of God?” asked Dr. Wynne, his condescension now hardening into derision.

“I am not the son of God. I am God himself.”

Dr. Wynne turned his pale blue eyes toward Joyce. There was a flash of tenderness between them, the sort of concerned look I saw when my parents were conferring about one of my problems.

“That’s all for now, Mason,” Dr. Wynne said, now pitying as if his estimation of my hope for recovery had fallen away, and he would henceforth have only bad news to pass on to me. Even Joyce looked sad, pinching her eyelids and biting her lower lip like a talk-show host listening to a weeping victim speak. 

By that time, the bulk of the day had passed, and when I got back to my room, I had to flip on the light switch to read my earlier work. Outside, the leaves shuddered shadows over a sky blending from salmon to violet. 

I wanted to feel the same air that moved between the leaves, but there was no way to move the window. It was only another lens to look through in hopes of seeing what naked eyesight could not. 

I had seen most of the hospital before. My father and mother had both worked in this place for years. I wondered if either of them was in the building, staying as far they could from their murderous child. 

The Dark Lord began to speak then. It occurred to me that if I took dictation from him, I might be able to let him out of my head. So, I wrote nearly twenty pages of legal paper in a little over an hour. The venting only fanned more air into the fire. I left my room, asking God for peace, hand in pain, and there mocking every prayer was my demonic tormentor. 

## Chapter 6

A few hours had passed since my meeting with the doctor, and he had gone home along with my therapist and the rest of the first shift staff. In the meantime, I had discovered a piano in one of the lounges and had spent almost an hour playing it. 

I tended to play the piano most often when I was fighting hallucinations. The wordlessness of music seemed to keep even the devil quiet. I don’t write music because I can; I write because I must. Along with visual art, it keeps the language out of my head. 

Language is almost always the way my condition manifests itself. Anything I do to silence the voices thus becomes a crucial coping skill.

The first thing I did once I got bored with those keys was to take up a pen. That was the other way I dulled my madness at its most acute: art. Again, the use of nonverbal aspects to my mind was key to lessening symptoms. It didn’t really matter what I drew, just as it didn’t really matter what I played – the process itself was what was efficacious, not its result.

The other patients seemed to know how therapeutic art of any kind could be. Most of them could be found scattered at tables across the ward, coloring banal pictures of animals. The action seemed to help them as much as my somewhat more creative outlet helped me. 

When I tired of doing my own work, I grabbed one of these pages and reworked the animal into a gestalt piece, something that could have been the original drawing but also could be perceived in a new way – two drawings in one.

I was at a round table on the border of the main room and a lounge, sitting with Carrie as she colored. I would whip through my double drawings every few minutes and then show them to her, and she would laugh. She had thick lips and a broad mouth, so she looked as if she could swallow her own head, but in a good way. 

She would look at what I was doing in awe and then look at me and say, “You are the one!” and laugh. 

I couldn’t tell whether she was humoring me, mocking me, or if the earnestness to her belief was substantial. That’s how it was with many of the patients who I seemed to have convinced of my divinity. Looking back, most of them probably just went along with me on it so that I would talk about something else, anything else.

There was one, however, who was almost certainly not just humoring me: my hymn-singer. Ever since I had revealed my Godhood to this rapid convert at the beginning of the day, he had been doing laps around the ward, praising me in a piercing falsetto. All his words were about his joy that the messiah had at last come and that he was the first witness of that coming. It was more annoying than anything. He had even taken his bed sheet and swaddled himself in it so that he looked like a mystic.

I asked a plump man with long, stringy hair if he had been doing this before I got there, and he shook his head. 

“You really put something in him,” he said, and it sounded as though he wanted to address me as “asshole” but lacked the passion for bothering. His body was covered in scars and slits that glowed red on the skin around them, infected. Some of these cuts looked fresh, and it was hard not to stare at his problem. 

“Pray to God to reveal himself to you, and you might have his joy, too,” I said.

“No good God would make me,” he said, “and I don’t want that anyway.” The cutter looked each way for staff and then slid a ballpoint pen into the pocket of his jeans. They sagged as he stood, needing a belt as they did, and he had to hitch them up by their belt loops twice on his way out of the room.

Dinner came just as it was time to smoke again, and I chose cigarettes over hot food. The patients gathered around the door to the smoking room, pulling on its knob when we all knew it was locked. One of the workers was supposed to come and open it for us. Usually, whoever did this came late. Almost five minutes had passed since we were supposed to be able to get in there. I looked at my watch. 

“He will walk around that corner in thirty-seven seconds,” I said. The cutter rolled his eyes. Carrie looked at her anime-themed wristband to count down. The suspense was there until, just as I said, he appeared on my time.

“A miracle!” my follower said. Then he pulled out his pack of little cigars and headed in. 

There is a camaraderie to the smoking room in a mental hospital that isn’t found anywhere else in the place. As it gets later in the day, and more people wake up from the medication, the group becomes more social. People swap flashes from case histories and talk about the drugs. 

We all had at least those subjects in common. Carrie and I talked about music. She liked a lot of the bands I had seen in better days when living near Detroit or in New York City. I told her stories from these places, as well. 

There was an immediacy to our friendship because we knew it wouldn’t last. Other than dependence on opiates, Carrie seemed to have few problems to speak of. As a result, it was only a matter of days before a bed opened at a treatment center, and she would be off to try recovery. 

We could talk about that, too. I gave Carrie the old clichés I knew from AA, especially emphasizing the whole one-day-at-a-time philosophy. “It works for everything,” I said, “but when you’re getting off something, it’s the only thing that works at all.”

There was an enormous cylindrical ashtray in the center of the room, nearly the size of a coffee table. Conversations usually didn’t cross this ashtray unless the whole place got on one topic. 

Recovery was the kind of topic that could bring something out of everyone. Nearly everyone in every hospital I have ever been to had been affected by addiction. Because the court system in Roosevelt is so likely to sentence those with drug and alcohol problems to twelve-step meetings, everyone usually had an informed opinion on them. 

“That shit works,” rasped a barely elderly woman. Her sweatshirt was silk-screened with kittens. “When I was going to meetings, that was the best I ever did.”

“If it works so well, why are you here?” asked a man in the scrubs given to patients when they arrived. The sleeves were short enough to show tattoos the length of his arms. His hair was obviously dyed red, with black roots. 

The kitten woman shrugged off the question.

“No,” said dyed hair, “I really want to know, does it work?”

“I’ve been sober for a few months,” I said. “I was sober for five years, but then I got sick and blamed God. It’s hard to stay in AA without Him.”

A quiet, silver-haired man in the corner opened his mouth as if to say something and then closed it again. He had another false start, and then: “I’ve been sober fourteen years. Then the pain pills got me.”

The truth is that if these programs worked as often as they claimed to, half the hospitals or more would shut down for lack of patients. While AA and other twelve-step groups don’t purport to directly heal mental illness, they do claim to arrest many of the symptoms of various diagnoses. Unfortunately, a lot of people can’t get better through recovery. The psychiatric hospitals seem to be a safety net for those who fall off the sober tightrope.

“It better work,” said Carrie. “It’s my only hope.”

A silence spread. The room focused on my friend. A woman to her right, old and sweet and flighty, stopped staring at the fluorescent light above us and squeezed Carrie’s knee and said, “You’ll be all right Honey. You’re still young enough not to be us.”

From across the ashtray, dyed hair asked her age. 

“Nineteen.”

The flighty woman said, “Ask the angels. The angels will set you free.”

She turned to me, her eyes intent and huge, and asked me if I were an angel.

“You know the answer to that,” I said. “It’s in your heart.”

The camaraderie of rooms like that is gone these days, or at least is gone in Michigan, where smoking indoors is now entirely forbidden. A Native American once told me that his people believed a man could not lie when smoking tobacco. That might be a stretch, but I have always found a sense of truth and peace to words shared over a cigarette. 

There may have been deeper reasons than I understood driving my two pack a day habit. Although there isn’t much good science backing any claims that nicotine helps people in any way, there have been studies where it has been shown to ease some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, like being catatonic. Perhaps, for this reason, over ninety percent of those with schizophrenia use nicotine in some form. The numbers and evidence on nicotine are not close to as compelling for bipolar disorder.  Perhaps I smoked to heal. 

I kept returning to a thought that Dr. Wynne had planted deep within me: perhaps I didn’t have bipolar disorder after all. With his every order, the Dark Lord offered more evidence that Dr. Wynne was right.

## Chapter 7

I was in the hospital because the demon put in my head kept telling me to kill my parents, with whom I had been living. Once reported, this medical condition took on legal ramifications. A personal protection order was put in place to keep me away from the people most threatened by my psychotic break. 

Apparently, my parents were not taking this court order very seriously. They never asked for it and nullified it within hours by consenting to see me voluntarily. I was glad they did. 

My mother walked in with a paper bag full of clothing for me, smiling weakly. She wore her scrubs, which meant she had been working a few floors above that day. Her shift had just ended, and she stopped to see me at this first opportunity.

My mother has a nose more pronounced than any of her children, but it is still relatively small. She looks a decade or two under her age. Her hair is dyed a deep brown and is bobbed. I saw a few of the older male patients do double-takes when they walked by her.

In the past, during the many times that I had been in hospitals like this, she had come in exuding love and usually with gifts or food as well. This time, though, she moved stiffly, and her eyes were a reservoir of pain and fear. 

I had never blown up as badly as I had the night before. She perhaps already sensed that I had changed and would never be the same again. That seemed to explain the distance she kept; she neither hugged me nor smiled with her eyes. Her lips arced, faking a smile. I appreciated the effort.

We took two seats in the dining area. Many small groups of patients were clustered around tables. Their chatter was intimate so that the place rattled with personal information that nobody beyond each table gave much mind to. My spot was no different.

“Have you seen the doctor yet?” mom asked.

“Unfortunately, yeah,” I said.  “He’s a real prick, and I’m going to take him down.”

“Do you have your own room?”

“That therapist’s a bitch, too. This place is going to burn.”

“I guess they’re all private rooms.”

“Listen, mom. I want to apologize.”

“Oh, honey,” she said, and her sense of detachment softened a bit, the corners of her brown eyes crinkling for the first time.

“No, I mean it. I don’t think you and dad were ready for the truth.”

A mask fell over her, one of blankness. Her eyes became as distant as the stars. If I noticed that I’d said the wrong thing, which I rarely did at that time, I ignored her reaction and pressed ahead anyway. “I am the messiah. That is just the way it is.  But I didn’t mean to be so… forceful with my proclamation.”

The blankness passed from my mother’s face, and she shaped it into one of cold rage. “You have no idea what you’ve done.” 

She stood to leave, and I didn’t stop her, but my father did. He wore a beaming grin that would have lit up more of the room had its darkness not been so thick. He didn’t seem to notice how flustered and furious mom was at once. If he did, he might well have attributed it to her lack of experience with the mentally ill. 

This attribution would be false - no one had spent more time with me when I was very sick than my mother. To see her thus twisted was to comprehend just how much violent force was needed to wring the compassion out of her.

My father must have assumed she was standing because she had just arrived, as he escorted her back to a seat, still without acknowledging her quiet rage. Again, she sat across from me. 

“Mom brought you your things?” my father asked.

“I don’t think you two understand the danger you’re in,” I said, my voice a hushed rasp.

“We’re not worried about the personal protection order if that’s what you mean,” my father said.

“Nothing can stop the Dark Lord but God. They are in me,” I told them.

“You were this same way when you were fourteen,” my mom said. “Except you kept talking about the devil.”

“He has many names,” I said, “But I call him the Dark Lord out of respect.”

“We were going to bring you some candy, but we knew you’d eat it all as soon as the meds kicked in,” my father said, laughing at his own humor when nothing seemed funny to my mother and me.

“He’s in me, mom. He’s in me, and he won’t leave.”

“Mason, everyone deals with the devil in a way,” my father said. “It’s in us all.”

“You don’t understand,” I said. “The demon can take me over. He did last night. He will do it again.” I twitched and shook, and my mother flinched.

“Maybe we should leave Mason so he can rest.”

“I’m not going to lie and say I’m better this time. I’ve heard this monster for too long to keep doing nothing about it.”

“You mean the voice that’s telling you what to do?” my father said, finally responding to my line of thinking rather than trying to distract me with small talk.

The last of the sun was fading in the skylights. There were no other windows in the main room.

The furniture, every piece of it throughout the whole place, was composed of round rectangles upholstered beige, with cream plastic connecting everything. The effect of the strange lighting and the uniform styling was to make the room look somewhat like the set of a space station on a television show. I felt like an alien lost among humans.

“I don’t blame you,” I said.

Mom nodded her head gently, but now my father was losing the coolness within him. 

“Of course you don’t,” my father said.

“It blames you,” I said. 

My parents looked at each other with unease. Then each quickly looked at the floor. I had never seen them so frazzled by my madness. Usually, nothing could affect their compassion.

It is easier, I believe, for most to sympathize with someone who is being told to commit suicide than it is for some who is being told to commit homicide. The violence is turned inward and is thus safe for everyone but its sufferer. I wasn’t safe for anyone anymore.

“What is it?” my mother asked.

“I know it comes from Sumer. I asked him where he came from.”

“Maybe it really is a possession,” my mother said, hushed so that the other tables couldn’t hear such an embarrassing comment.

“I’ve asked to see a Catholic priest,” I said.

I waited for my dad to make a derisive comment about the supernatural explanation, but he just sat there, looking blankly, still at the floor. My mother called his name, and he snapped up as if catching himself before nodding out in public.

“I don’t want to rule anything out,” I said, trying to muster the authority of a dramatized physician. It was almost a mockery of my father’s tone, and he might have caught the mimicry.  

He winced. Then he looked at me accusingly for just one second, but a long second, before putting on the face of kindness he had when he’d entered.

My father fits the criteria for bipolar disorder. I confronted him on this on many occasions, but he always deflected the problem towards me again. The attempts backfired like this every time. 

Only once, once, had he admitted to having the condition but said he wouldn’t take medication for it because the side effects would limit his productivity. 

When he swings like that, like I had just seen in his eyes, I can always tell. His mood changes have hints that they are coming, like the aura of an epileptic fit, if it could be seen from the outside. It was time for me to get rid of them before he lost it.

“I’m going to sleep now. Thanks for coming.”

We stood, and I walked them out to the locked entrance, where a handsome mental health worker stood smiling with gladness that felt genuine. My mom hugged me and held me hard to her, keeping me there for longer than I could ever remember her doing. “I love you,” she said. 

The cruel voice told me to just let that fall unanswered. I had to fight it for control of my mouth, to force comparable words of affection out of myself. “I love you both,” I said.

Now it came hard, as they were near, while there was a chance, repetitively, furiously, so forcibly that mental spit was flecking out of the mouth of my mind – the voice said, “Kill them,” over and over and over and over. I started twitching and couldn’t smile as they left me to my madness.

I thought again about my father’s bipolar disorder. He had projected it on to me, and I on to him. Only it wasn’t mine anymore. It was hard to say whether the nature of my malady had changed or if its true nature had been revealed. 

Though I had finished two degrees, I had never been able to support myself, except for the summer of 2001. That that was the best summer of my life didn’t feel coincidental. Perhaps I had been a misdiagnosed person with schizophrenia the whole time. 

The thought didn’t reassure me. The prognosis for my new problem was worse, so accuracy in discerning it wouldn’t necessarily offer a better chance of recovery. The cruel fact was that I had a good chance of suffering under the orders of evil for the rest of my life. 

Even remission wasn’t promised. The drugs to treat my problem were some of the same ones I had been on for mood stabilization. There wasn’t hope that changes there would make much difference. There wasn’t much hope at all.

Night finally fell on the long first day of my treatment. At that time, I wasn’t so despairing. I was optimistic that the whole situation would be resolved in several days at most. It was only a matter of increasing doses and perhaps some rest. But my overeducated doctor hadn’t increased anything, and I was to learn that night how hard it was going to be to sleep on only 200 milligrams of Seroquel, perhaps twenty percent of the dose any other doctor would prescribe.

Medication time came after a lively smoke break, more chatter, and fast friendship that would be of no consequence once the walls fell away. As I waited in line next to Carrie, and she gave me a tender look, I wasn’t delusional about one thing – I knew there was no chance I would ever get to know her outside of this place, not necessarily because I wouldn’t want to or have a way to. 

It just never works out, or never has, in my experience, that someone from the hospital becomes a lasting friend. Not only that, but also there is nothing on the order of Alcoholics Anonymous for the mentally ill.

In that sense, the mental hospital is like fighting a war where you never really connect with any fellow veterans. We walk past each other in the streets, kin closer than kin, never knowing the relation.

## Chapter 8

That first night in the hospital was a long one. I awoke just after midnight, full of energy for the next day. I had gone to bed at ten. I was suffering the consequences of too little medication. That had been reduced from 300 mg of Seroquel before the hospital to 200 mg. I was on no further medications.

The result was that I had plenty of time to try to figure things out, which was all the psychiatrist thought I needed to do. Unfortunately, it is difficult to figure out much of anything when you are psychotic. That didn’t stop me from trying.

One of the first things I did upon awakening was to read two pages from Psalms in the Gideon bible I’d found in my top drawer. I particularly liked the ones about righteous battle. I felt I was in such a conflict and that it would only intensify once I was released from the hospital. After all, a messiah had a lot of battling to do if the world was to be saved from itself.

I had a great deal on my mind. Not only did I have to deal with an uncooperative treatment team who wouldn’t help me with medication, but I also had the world beyond the hospital to think about fixing as well. 

I had a friend who lived near Detroit who worked high up in a globally recognized news site with a Trotskyite bent. I had some ideas about how to start a worldwide revolution, and I hoped he would put them in place. If I could get him on board, we could use his channels to spread the revolution beyond Michigan. I was hoping he wouldn’t resent me so much from my messiness that us uniting forces would be a problem. I never cleaned our room when I shared it in college.

He lived near Detroit, and Detroit felt as though it would be the place where the flood would overflow. So much about the Earth needed washing. All I had to do was make it rain.

These ideas clustered around the fact that Michigan has as much access to freshwater as anywhere on earth. This water, if controlled properly, could be used as leverage against governments and as a resource to support the finances of a violent revolution. 

The fact that the struggling classes of metro Detroit were often already armed could help our cause. All that was to be done was to unite these wild, violent elements and use them to conjure something unstoppable. It had happened in so many other countries. Why couldn’t it happen in America? And why shouldn’t I be the one to lead it?

This line of thinking more than made sense in those days. It felt inevitable. The hospital was just a training ground. God had put me there to test me, that from the test, I might learn valuable lessons that would help me along on my ascendance to a throne over the universe. 

I didn’t talk about this megalomania as freely as I spoke of my godhood. Jesus was almost exclusively kind, and the thought that I was like him was less threatening than what I felt was the truth. I was going to bring back the lightning bolts and sulfur, for God had much to do to fix a world that belonged to the Dark Lord.

I kept these plots to myself not because I thought they would make me sound crazy, but because they were so good that I was afraid someone would steal them and rise in my stead. Paranoia was setting in. 

When you make the entire world an enemy to be conquered, it is hard not to feel that everyone in it might be out to stop you. Of course, people would be resistant. So anyone could be an enemy, and trust was a weakness of character. The flood was coming, and I didn’t want any other arks around.

Despite my assurance in these mad ambitions, there was still a part of me, some agency that the madness didn’t touch. I would find myself over maps I had drawn, battle plans and speeches, and the book in progress about my struggle, and think, something must stop me, and I am the only one who can. 

In these clearings of mind, I would realize how ridiculous I was becoming. These thoughts were quickly pushed aside in favor of empowering psychosis, but they also returned frequently, their truth haunting me.

After going through my daily preparations for the coming war between good and evil, I would walk over to the nurse’s station and look for someone to rant to. I would awaken no later than two am in the beginning. 

There would be no hope for sleep. I would be pulsing with charged blood, ready to swallow the world in a deluge. I would eat soggy turkey sandwiches and envision the world to come. Then I would find someone to complain to.

There was a male nurse a few years older than me who always seemed to be on the night shift. Tom had a goatee and buzzed hair, both brown. I would call him away from the nurse’s station and talk at him for hours. I never got the feeling that he was listening much. 

He would interject, “I hear you,” into my rants every so often, but that little phrase, over and over, only made me feel as if he didn’t hear me at all. I ran all my problems by him and never got a single solution. He was like a bartender who offered no drinks and a deaf ear but was still worth venting to anyway.

My follower, the singing one, seemed to have a lot of trouble sleeping, too. He never seemed to stop pacing his course through the main room. At first, he even caterwauled at the same volume, but Tom had told him to be quiet. 

He kept singing, but at a much lower volume. His bed sheet sarong showed less skin than scrubs would have. It was so long that it had a train dragging behind him, and sometimes during the silences between the tracks he played, I could hear that sheet swish against the floor.

Nights meant a long haul without a cigarette: almost twelve hours. More than anything, that is what I wanted to get back to sleep. Before I came into the hospital, I was smoking around two packs of cigarettes a day. That was physically impossible in my new setting. Still, my body burned for nicotine in the middle of the night, and there was no getting any.

When I wasn’t jawing at Tom, I spent the sleepless nights in my room, usually writing. I couldn’t keep my narrative coherent. I would start off lucid but watch my work drift off into the sky, further and further away from any grounding. 

What was supposed to be a straight story kept turning into prose poetry, whether I liked it or not. Other times I would let the Dark Lord write through me to figure out what he was up to, letting him move my hand as if I were playing with an Ouija board that really worked.

That was how just about every day after the first one got going – hours before anyone else in the place could drag themselves through the resistance of drugs toward the smoking room. Most of the other patients were depressed and wanted to sleep more than anything. 

My follower and I were obviously wound in the opposite direction. We buzzed through the night under pressure. A power washer without a target arcing into space, its potential usefulness offering only futility: I flowed that way.

I fell into such a rhythm in those hospital days, and it seemed at times that the routine was the only way I could structure my thoughts. The push toward the sunrise would end when I was joined by the few patients who were restless enough to rise before food and smoking were available. 

Even these early birds didn’t leave the nest until six at the earliest. I could not talk to this follower. All he did was bow like a Japanese courtesan or sing to me like a castrated monk. Convincing someone that you are God really limits your rapport. 

When my more skeptical peers would rise, I would have people and not supplicants to talk to. We would discuss psychopharmacology and the weather, and the occasional childhood trauma. I would listen and look forward to the day that I could save them all.

After the first few days, I kept the truth of my godhood closer to my chest. The damage had been done to my follower. But it wasn’t that I wanted to limit such shows of devotion; they would be inevitable in the coming years. I mostly hid it so that I could blend in, pass for human, and be regarded as just another patient. 

There is nothing quite like the intoxication of grandiose delusions. I have long been an addict, sometimes in the specific drugs-and-alcohol sense. But for me, none of these substances were ever stronger or longer-lasting than the intoxication of my own exuberant psychosis. Thanks to the medical decision not to treat me, sobriety in negative was making me worse one day at a time. 

When it was finally time to have the morning cigarette, I always seemed the most awake. The believer would sit in the corner, singing under his breath. Carrie, at least in those first days, would lean on my shoulder and pretend to go back to sleep. 

There were others who came to take her place. There still seemed to be a point in getting to know these people. So, we talked and laughed and complained. 

Everyone except for me had the same goal – to be discharged. It wasn’t that I wanted to stay in the hospital forever. The part of me that even my megalomania had no power over, the mind of my mind, knew I would need a long, long stay. But if you had told me how long that stay would have to be, I would have believed you were as crazy as my heart knew I was.

## Chapter 9

On the second day of my stay, Carrie told me she was being discharged that afternoon and transferred to a drug treatment center. I was happy for her but sad to lose someone to distract me from my mission. 

She gave me a photo of herself holding a giant tabby cat to remember her by. On the back was a brief, sweet thank you note with her phone number following the signature. She left, and it hurt a little. But I wasn’t crazy enough to use the Unit as a dating service, and I’ve never called the number.

The first smoking break without her was less comfortable. I didn’t have her to remind me of an era when getting sober and well was a novel concept. I still needed someone to listen to me. I was done seeming sane, but I needed others who were trying to do just that. They make for the only pleasant company in a place like the Unit.

Seeming sane is a precious talent. It has gotten me many jobs for which I interviewed well and at which I performed poorly. I’d worked eleven different jobs for a month or less before giving up and quitting. Even the roles I had held for months – Starbucks, The Paris Review – still ended when I lost it and quit. The only job I’d managed to keep was working for my father as a medical scribe, and this hospitalization would end that, I was certain.

Yet the idea that I was disabled by a severe mental illness to the extent that I was unable to support myself without Social Security still felt false, even though I had applied for disability at the urging of my parents. While I had been dependent on my parents when earning undergraduate and graduate degrees in Creative Writing, I still finished. That I never worked full time while I got my MFA didn’t mean I should give up on ever working again. Still, I was a quitter without a meaningful resume in a county with high unemployment and few jobs requiring desks.

There was one type of work I was always able to do and do relatively well. I write. My mother’s side of the tree is gnarled with writers at various levels of success. Most found work in marketing or advertising, like my sister Stacy, who had earned the same creative writing degree at the same university as I did. Now I had more degrees, she was a successful businessperson, and the only book I was able to write at that time was a plan for a cult. At one point, family members and teachers had cheered my parade down the path my sister had walked, but my days as a boy wonder were history. So, every time I got back to my room and picked up a pen, it was with a sense of urgency that I might make good on my potential at last by saving humankind.

The Unit had yet to end the notions in my family that I held promise or even baseline functionality as an adult. I was writing the tragedy with my every move thinking it would end differently for me, but hubris never works out in the end. On Day 2, however, it felt like a good sign that I felt better than everyone else. I looked at the world without the perspective or distance to see more than the wide pixels of my story’s bitmap; all I saw was obvious and distorted by short-sightedness.

Still, all day, as staff and patients passed my open door, I sat fighting commands from the Dark Lord to stab them with the ballpoint pen in my hand. I couldn’t write a straight story. I would move the pen with an organized thought in my head, and it would come out as a tangle of prose poetry, mostly thorns with the occasional bloom. 

The more I tried to untangle the metaphors and reveries, the stranger they seemed to get. I felt like Midas with a second superpower, turning the solid into hot air. I would touch order, and it would scatter into chaos.

After those long days of writing, I would eat and smoke some more, then usually head out into the main room and see if anyone else wanted to doodle or at least color next to me. I always found somebody for that. I kept all my drawings in one green, hard-bound journal. 

I would create them with that dangerous pen, start with a random squiggle, and then turn the arbitrary line into something realistic. This art often soothed me until I was no longer being told to attack others anymore.

Shortly after Carrie left, during the second shift for nurses, I was making the usual art when a nurse came to do my intake. Sandra was slim, with dark brown skin and white cropped hair. She wore a pair of rectangular reading glasses around her neck, but her eyes jumped and shot with a bright intensity that made me believe she could see anything without correction.  

There was something regal about the way she carried herself, as if she were the queen of this hell, Persephone in winter, and everyone knew it. I later learned that she had the most seniority of any nurse, which may have been why it felt like her Unit as soon as she clocked in. 

The hierarchy in a behavioral health ward is such that the charge nurse, the nurse running the floor, has more authority than anyone else once providers like psychiatrists are no longer working. Below the charge nurse are the other nurses, then the mental health workers, in something like a chain of command. Thus, a nurse working off-hours could have more power than anyone else in the ward at a given time, making Sandra an important force whose authority would eventually change my life.

Sandra had been off on my first day in, but as soon as she met me, she took me aside. No one had done my formal intake, so we went into a private room and began. She had a lovely drawl in her speech that seemed to warm every word that followed. “What’s a nice boy like you doing in a place like this?

“I am God, and I want to kill my parents.”

“Honey, if you’re God, you don’t have any parents.”

“I don’t really feel either of my parents in my heart. It’s just… the demon that was put inside me.”

She nodded. I looked at the name tag on her gentle breast. “I don’t believe you want to kill your mommy and daddy. I’ve seen plenty like that in my day, and you are not that. What’s really going on?”

“I went to school in New York City. I graduated and moved back here. I moved into a house with a bunch of crazy guys. One of them was a Satanist, and when I had to kick him out, he put a demon in me. Ever since, I can’t get that evil voice out of my head. The demon wants me to kill my parents. It’s all a test, though, because I am God.” I felt all of these statements made the same amount of sense and spoke as such.

Sandra crossed her arms. “You do believe you’re God, don’t you?”

“Every cell in my body screams that that is the truth. That I am God, the Father, sent back to earth to save humankind from itself.”

Sandra sighed deeply and sadly.

“You want to do me a favor?” I asked.

She smiled. “Anything, baby.”

“Pray to God for him to reveal the truth about me to you.”

She didn’t blink like I thought she would. “I will put that in my prayers before I go to bed.”

“Promise?” I asked.

She smiled, a smile of white shine that lit my dark heart. “Of course. But God said only he knows when he is coming, you know that..”

“Of course I do. Only I do.”

We both laughed. Sandra kept smiling warmly, but her eyes seemed to show worry about my welfare. Unlike the others, she never looked worried that I might affect hers.

“Can I ask… You ask that of all the boys, don’t you – that first line about this nice place?”

“It works miracles.”

I smiled at her and winked. “You’ll see plenty of those in the days to come.”

“I hope you’re right,” she said.

“Right about being God?”

“Right about miracles.”

“And this God thing?”

Again, the sad sigh. “I’m not going to say I know you aren’t Him. If you are, though, I worry about your life after this. You’ll have to be tough, maybe the toughest there ever was. I know one thing,” the nurse said and paused, leaving me in suspense. At last: “The world could sure use God about now.”

The private room where we sat was covered with insipid catchphrases that aimed to teach recovery from mental illness. Bulletin boards on each wall were tacked with brass fastening more triteness. It has always bothered me that what seems to heal me are not brilliant, original ideas, but worn out and tattered clichés so axiomatic that this solidness offers rock for a foundation. If only what was clever could heal, I probably wouldn’t have been as sick as I was.

I rose to leave, and she joined me on her feet. The door opened, and as we were walking out, I looked at her again, long and lovingly, as if I’d met my mother at last. There was a sense of peace that came over me beside her. 

This woman had seen forty years’ worth of people like me. Maybe she would know a way out of my terrifying destiny. As we walked astride, I turned and spoke to Sandra for the last time that night. “Don’t forget to pray,” I said.

“Baby, I never do.” Then she was back behind the nurses’ station, indiscernible as my personal protection from other forces in the hospital staff.

The next afternoon, she came in looking very serious and took me aside soon after her shift began. “You are him,” she said in a low voice. “I know it now, and I will do everything I can to help you.” 

This faith excited and terrified me. It meant I had an ally, but it also meant I might have to fight a war beside her. Real or false, my belief was convincing seemingly sane people to follow me, making it real regardless. My sense of purpose grew even as it made no sense to me.

## Chapter 10

I had my last drink about five months before entering the Unit. Since then, I had been living in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Ever since my first drink in 1996, my reaction to alcohol has been unpredictable and abnormal. 

Because I had a protracted bout of psychosis a year before my hospitalization, the stakes of such reactions were high. Everyone I knew never wanted me to drink alcohol again. More importantly, by September 2007, I felt the same way.

So I took the work of the twelve steps very seriously, and when my sponsor in Alcoholics Anonymous gave me the assignment of defining insanity and sanity, I put my head down. Eschewing the party line of AA that insanity is doing the same thing but expecting different results, he told me to find a personal meaning for the term. 

That I ended up insane for months after that could be seen as a sort of fieldwork if your sense of humor is perverse enough. I needed to do some investigating and role-playing to give the most informed answer I could.

It was not an unusual assignment to come down from a sponsor. In that position, an experienced member of AA works as a mentor to a less experienced member. Daily contact with a sponsor, as well as weekly meetings, are also standard. 

The twelve steps can be broken down into three directives – trusting a higher power, analyzing and the redressing of wrongs done, and helping other alcoholics along with the process after a cycle completes. There’s a slogan that puts it most simply: trust God, clean house, help others. 

Ideally, a sponsor has gone through most or all of this process. How these principles are executed varies from member to member, each sponsor generally passing down the way they were taught. Emphasis is placed on studying AA literature, especially the central text known as the “Big Book” and its directions and, to a lesser extent, The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, an explanation of the program rather than instructions on a way to do it. The process is never supposed to end, and most of the members who stay sober for years and decades continue this process over and over, often a different way each time.

My sponsor Lee was a short firecracker from Louisiana with nearly black hair and a full mustache. He worked as a carpenter and had restored many historical homes around Roosevelt, but that work had slowed down, and now he was fixing bleachers at football stadiums across the state. He was and remains as sharp as any therapist I’ve ever met. 

Lee is that rare kind of know-it-all who knows almost everything and is excellent at faking what he doesn’t, with respect to the program and much of life as well. I got him as a sponsor because I wanted answers after my relapse, just as I wanted answers from him as he sat across from me in the main room of the hospital.

Lee slid a pack of cigarettes across the table. He didn’t smoke. He had quit smoking some years back. Because he had smoked, however, Lee understood that cigarettes are sometimes all you have during the difficulties of breaking alcohol and drug dependence. In this case, he probably figured the hospital made my early recovery even harder and offered the gift as a gesture of goodwill. To me, the pack of Marlboro Reds meant that he acknowledged my plight.

My sponsor usually had a wry smile on his face, but he was grave during that first meeting. 

“I guess I’ll really know insanity by the time I get out of here,” I said.

He still didn’t smile; instead, all I got was a stern nod.

“There’s a reason a higher power puts people in situations like yours,” Lee said.

I didn’t bother asking him what that reason was. I knew he would tell me unbidden. His advice was often unwanted but rarely unneeded. “Yeah, this is going to make you stronger, but more importantly, it’s going to let you help people who are going through what you’re going through now. People who need your help in here are going to seek you out, too.”

“I got a girl in here to go to treatment already,” I said.

“Exactly what I’m talking about,” Lee said.

“I think I know what sanity is,” I said. There were other patients with families, and their clusters surrounded us in the main room. A few of these clusters perked up as soon as I said the word sanity. “It’s expecting different results from doing something different.”

Lee laughed softly to himself. It was a good-natured laugh as if he were taken by surprise and did not know how else to react. “That’s clever, Mason, very clever, but you’re still missing the point.”

“Obviously,” I almost shouted, getting frustrated with this mentor. Every previous sponsor I’ve had, and I’d had several, were less maddening than Lee. “I’m in a fucking mental hospital. I can’t define sanity. I can’t even define insanity.”

“Easy now,” Lee drawled in the calming way he always took to calm me down. “There are people in here who know my answer. They may not be like you, but they have far more training and knowledge about people like you than you do.”

“I doubt it,” I said. “I know an awful lot about what I have.”

“I’m not talking about knowledge. Knowledge got you this far, Mason. I’m talking about techniques. Ways to treat your problem that you don’t find in books explaining it.”

“Now they’re telling me I’m not bipolar. They’ve known me a week, and they’re contradicting every doctor I’ve ever had.”

“They might be onto something. If you’ve been diagnosed wrong, it sure explains why you keep ending up in these places.”

“I’m just here because I drank.” In March of 2007, I celebrated five years of continuous sobriety. In May of 2007, I went on a weeklong bender and then came back to the program. The relapse knocked down my pride, but it also changed my conception of my own identity. I had been more than just a sober guy, at least in my own mind. I was the one who got right at only twenty-one, the boy wonder of Roosevelt AA. That person was dead, and I was grieving who I was not.

“You also went off your medication,” said Lee. “That’s just as bad as a relapse for you.”

Shortly after my fifth anniversary, and for reasons I still cannot explain, I went off all my antidepressant medication but stayed on the downers. I had been in a brutal fight with new symptoms – command hallucinations, voices telling me what to do – and I wanted to be down enough to give up. At least, that’s the best I can figure now: I wanted to die, and I was willing to do or not do anything to get the strength to do so. 

Once again, Lee had hit upon the core issue.

“They won’t change my medication here. They say it’s not the problem. The reason I’m sick is environmental,” I said, almost hissing, disgusted.

“Mason, they know more than you do. Maybe it’s time you took their point.”

My identity had been as wrapped up in my self-identification as someone who was bipolar as it had been with my years of sobriety. Now that schizophrenia was being mentioned more and more often, I felt that I had lost the last vestige of who I was, and the shock had yet to wear off. 

I was still in fierce denial that I could be anything other than bipolar, even as the voices told me how to act and what to say. Really it was another pride issue. I had read thousands of pages about mood disorders and almost nothing about schizophrenia. To admit to this new description was to acknowledge how little I really knew about what was wrong with me and how I could get better.

At this point, the Dark Lord started calling for Lee’s head. I told him it was time for him to leave and that I wasn’t feeling well. I didn’t mention that my demon was describing the location of the aorta I needed to stab. 

It was then that it first became hard and fast that this dark part of me wanted to threaten off everyone who sought to help me. The Dark Lord had the most power over me when I was alone. It sought to divide me from those who loved me and then conquer what little was left of who I was. This realization came strong as the voice in my head spat insults after the Southerner making his way out of the place.

It was a week into my hospitalization. The staff had started to mention discharge. The problem was not that I was doing poorly. I had managed to smash a great deal of the messianic delusions and had yet to cut myself on the pieces. 

The problem was that there was nowhere for me to go. The court-ordered treatment demanded that I not live with any family member. That left me calling around for goodwill and hospitality. 

One friend offered to put me up, but the treatment team didn’t have confidence in him; he was less than a year sober, and there was worry one or both of us could relapse.  Talk of sending me to the rescue mission made me desperate enough to call and call and call, fearing that I would be just another religious radical sleeping on the streets and dreaming of streets of gold.

The dream of godhood was in me still. I had been lulled to sleep in a cradle of denial, but I was a long way from accepting what was obvious – that I couldn’t be God. On the weekends, the second psychiatrist would come in and triple my dosage of antipsychotics. 

Suddenly, faith in my divinity seemed ludicrous, and I was able to sleep free of that ridiculous burden keeping me awake with its pain. Then the regular staff got back and cut my dosage to a third of what it had been, and I would go back to being God again. 

I was coming off a good weekend when I met Lee, but my discharge was scheduled for Friday. I was trudging ahead with a demon on my back, but the load felt lighter after two days back on a high dose of antipsychotics. I might have held the demon at bay until I could lock him up in the basement of my head, if I had been allowed the drugs that I desperately needed.

There are better ways to burden yourself than a demon or even a cross.

## Chapter 11

I swear to God I wasn’t the only one convinced I was Him.

One of the reasons I believed I was God the Father for so long was because others seemed to believe that truth as well. My most powerful apparent believer was Sandra, the longest serving nurse in the Unit. As a charge nurse when the providers had gone home for the day, Sandra ran the unit from three pm to ten pm more days than not.

With such a powerful ally, I said whatever I wanted to say about my delusion to anyone who would listen. 

I converted people mostly in the smoking room. Midway through that stay, I was smoking directly across from Steve, my believer who had paced the halls singing hymns about me ever my first day. Steve was tone deaf with a falsetto singing voice. His new belief system seemed to have prolonged his stay by several days at least, and yet I felt no guilt about transforming him into a wreck of religiosity. 

Steve’s path to heaven was clear if he followed me.

As one devotee sat still and quiet, I was preaching to Al, a middle-aged man with a thin beard and aviator glasses. We were both on our third cigarette, letting our food get cold to get as much nicotine as possible. The rest of the patients had left us three to eat a warm breakfast.

“Ever since I was born, I have known on some level that I am the messiah,” I said. “The only difference now is that I’m committed to being honest with everyone about what I believe. I need to be truthful if I want to be set free.”

“Word to the wise,” said Al, “Nobody ever got out of a mental hospital telling the truth about what was going on in their head.”

“Every cell in me sings the truth in unison,” 

“You really believe, don’t you,” said Al. 

“Well, it’s been a few days on almost no meds. Wynne slashed my only med back to 200 milligrams. He didn’t even wean me down. Just chop,” I said and karate chopped the air. “The weekend doctor had raised it to 1200. On Monday, after two days on six times as much, I was ready to give up my faith.”

“Even Christ asked God why he had been forsaken. Who knows what kind of doubts he would have had if he were medicated,” said Al.

“He also said only God himself knew when He was coming back. Well, here I am. How many times in life have you met someone who knew he was God?”

“I was in Kalamazoo for almost a year,” Al said, referring to the state psychiatric facility, “And I never met anyone like you there. I mean, I did what you said. I prayed to God for a sign that you were telling the truth, and he answered, clear in my head, the right thing to do was to believe in you.”

“Thank you.”

“You’re about to say that again.”

Al took off his wrist watch and put it in my hand.

“You’re getting out soon,” Al said. “I want you to have something so you won’t forget to pray for me.”

“It’s very nice,” I said, holding the digital watch up like it was a diamond I was inspecting. “I can’t pay for this,” I said, wary of a scam.

“I would give anything I own for your blessing. I need something. Something’s got to turn all this around.”

“Thank you,” I said. As I welled up with tears, I took a long drag from my cigarette, and for some reason that stopped me short of crying. “It’s weird. I feel this joy whenever anyone believes me. It never happened until I was in here.”

“Must be destiny.”

“Predestination,” I said. “It used to really bother me, but then I thought, maybe all the physicists in the world are wrong. Maybe everything we all move toward all the time has already happened and we are just moving through time like it is fixed space. I don’t believe in free will, not anymore. If you’re going to be saved, you’re going to be saved.”

“Amen,” said my follower, the singer. “The words of the Lord.”

“Ordinarily, I would refuse the gift,” I said. “But I was just thinking, I need a watch to sleep, so I don’t jump out of bed at midnight to check the clock at the front desk and stay up for the day. Why is there only one clock in this damn place? Then you put this watch in my hand.”

“God is good,” Al said.

“Yes I am,” I said, and no one batted an eye. We all finished our cigarettes at the same time and left together, with Steve holding the door for us after bowing to me, Japanese style.

Lincoln opened the softly squeaking door to let us out and lock up the smoking room until the next break. After it clanked shut, I thought about the locks between me and the world. 

I was still skipping groups to work on my religious tracts, so I headed to my office to scrawl more of my testament on a legal pad. After a few hours, my hand was tired from writing, and I wanted to play the piano instead. I had to wait outside of where a group was being held for the room to clear out, so I got to listen to several of Steve’s hymns to me as he paced the halls glorifying me.

I was finishing up at the piano when a graying redhead named Susan walked in. She glowed with the light of the Holy Spirit. At that time, I believed I could tell on sight whether someone was saved. Susan had definitely asked Jesus into her heart to be her personal Savior. 

“You have a light about you,” she said, “and a darkness.”

“I am God,” I said.

“You’re not Jesus.”

“No. I’m his dad.”

She crossed her arms and lowered her eyebrows.

“And you hear the Devil. That’s what someone said.”

“Who?”

“A nurse actually. She said to avoid you, that they’re all afraid of you. I don’t know why she told me that. Maybe she belongs here too.”

I laughed and covered my face. I was enjoying how much I disturbed the staff, even those that weren’t trying to destroy me like Joyce.

Susan wasn’t even smiling, preferring to stare straight into me, unblinking. “How do you know it’s not the Devil telling you you’re God? Isn’t that the simplest explanation?”

“Listen. It’s Susan, right?”

Susan nodded and uncrossed her arms. Her expression softened but she still looked afraid.

“Susan, I tell the Devil what to do. He could be my sidekick. I need him to do his job, but he’s harmless to me. I made him just like I made everything else.”

Susan blinked and then turned her blue eyes away from me as she spoke, staring at the treble C key on the piano as she spoke. “You don’t know, do you? That a demon can take on any voice and seem like anyone once it is in you.”

“Who said anything about demons?”

“There is one in you. I can feel it across the room. Wow. It’s like nothing I’ve ever felt.”

She was still on treble C with her eyes, avoiding giving me even a glance. 

“If you must know, yes, my Satanist roommate put a demon from the ancient city of Sumer into me last year after I kicked him out for dealing Ecstasy in our house.”

Sarah looked through me, horrified, as if I were translucent and had a surreal monster behind me.

“You’re not joking.”

“If it were a joke, I wouldn’t be here,” I said.

“Does it talk through you?”

“Yes.”

“Does it always talk through you? Am I talking to it now?”

“I don’t even know anymore,” I said, frowning. 

She was still looking through me as I looked away.

I felt defeated. Had my whole life been the work of a demon? Nothing made sense. All those months in adolescence thinking I was the Godhead incarnate - they predated Redd’s magic. What didn’t was my homicidal rage. 

“Do you know its name?”

“Usually it just says when asked, ‘I have many names.’ Seems to prefer being called the Dark Lord, though,” I said.

The whites of Susan’seyes flashed wide. She shook slightly and backed away from me with a quick, jerky step behind herself, as if moving by reflex.

“So you do hear the Devil himself,” she said, turning her gaze back to the treble C key. “I will pray for you.”

“Yes,” I said. “Ask God to reveal my true identity to you, and you will know I am Him.”

“No thanks. I don’t like inviting Satan into my prayer life.”

“I’m not Satan. I’m just in regular communication with him. But that’s not all. Jesus talks. So does Mother Mary… she gives me dating advice.”

“I’m glad you’re here, believe it or not,” said Susan, before turning to leave. Then, over her shoulder without looking at me: “I hope they find a place to put you where you can actually get better. You need it. Nobody gets well in the Unit. They only get worse.”

As she left, I turned back to the piano and sat to play again. I hit treble C. Then I just sat still and cried softly. Why wouldn’t my grandiose delusions be from the same place as my auditory hallucinations? It had to be the Dark Lord’s work - all of it. 

How could I know right from wrong if my devil could speak to me as anyone?

I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, remembering when my faith that I was the messiah came from a place of peace, a ridiculous ambition to be another Gandhi or Martin Luther King. After Redd’s incantation, however, rage had overcome my kindness. Talking to Susan, I hadn’t heard the demon. I suspected that the Dark Lord avoided someone so devout. After she left, however, the voice came back in a new way.

“Kill the killers,” it said. “Kill the killers. Kill them all. Justice. Justice now. Kill the killers.”

For the first time, I felt that the Dark Lord could be a source of fuel, one that could power my vengeance against those who deserved it. I could do great good if I aimed my rage onto deserving targets. A real vigilante hero.

“Kill the killers.”

I started writing a waltz, a walking part in three-quarter time. Focusing on the melody to drive all words from my head: that was often the reason I played music. It made the auditory hallucinations fade into the background.

I had clarity now, and a mission ahead of me. 

Wynne and Joyce would pay. I wasn’t sure how yet, but I knew that if I stayed there much longer, open conflict was inevitable. With my allies - my dad on my hospital’s board; my dad’s best friend, the CEO of the parent health system that owned the Unit; Sandra running cover for me most evenings - I might even win. 

It didn’t occur to me yet that winning would be the worst case scenario.

## Chapter 12

A week later, toward the end of that stay in the behavioral health unit, it was decided that all my family should be called in for a therapy session. By this point the days had begun to blur together due to monotony. No longer did every event seem significant and worth remembering. The family therapy session stood out among a wash of meals and menus, therapy and groups, cigarettes and sleep. My doctor and my therapist both thought that by observing our family dynamic in action, they could confirm theories explaining my deterioration and potentially preventing another one. 

I had been told in a session only a day or so before that I was conditioned to lose my mind. When I was having a hard time with life, my breaking down got me sympathy rather than frustration on the part of my family. Moreover, Dr. Wynne and Joyce posited, I was often pampered during problematic times. I thus had the incentive to go nuts over and over. Staying sane only meant more responsibility and accountability and less coddling. Why would I stay sane for that when the alternative could be so appealing? My pair of healers wanted to confirm this idea by watching us at work.

The only child who could come was my older brother Chuck. Stacey was far away working her dream job in Vermont, and Ty had midterms over at the University of Michigan. It was somewhat appropriate that the family member who was most detrimental to my sanity, at least in my youth, was present along with my parents. 

By 2007, Chuck and I had settled into a passive-aggressive battle-of-wits type relationship; there was little outright malice. Still, we were antipathetic, and that didn’t change much even in my addled state.

While I initially had lashed out at my mother along with the rest, our interactions had always been affectionate, if physically distant. There was little rage left in me that was directed toward her, only dull resentment related to my financial problems. Having parents who failed to warn me about consumer debt in the early 2000s was unremarkable. But I felt that my mother had actually encouraged behaviors that would destroy my credit because she believed, and likely rightly, that I would never be able to handle money. In her view, a few credit card shopping sprees during young manic episodes would amputate my chances of falling into more adult and dangerous trouble with mortgages and small business loans.  In my view, of course, she was culpably negligent in the loss of my future financial freedom.

Dad was there, and I could feel the puppet strings flowing toward me as if he were Spiderman. He knew both my psychiatrist and my therapist; he was a friend and respected colleague to them, and that image of him prevented them from understanding my rage toward him.  As a doctor, my father was gentle, patient, and loving, and so, though Dr. Wynne and Joyce believed that his treatment methods had piloted me into this latest nosedive, crash, and explosion, they saw it only as paternal excess of care. No colleague of his would believe my descriptions of his mockery or his outright violence; when I tried to recount these things, it was all written off as melodrama.

No, in this matter, only the Dark Lord truly sympathized with me and sent command hallucinations ordering my father’s assassination.  And I was keeping that mostly to myself. Sharing that symptom had done little good. There was no incentive for solving that problem. It blew their theory out of the water. I had tried to explain this, however, and had gotten nowhere. 

For that matter, when I tried to explain anything to my therapist, she met me with hostile skepticism that only enraged me further, at least inside. Over and over, I was told I had borderline personality disorder and that my psychotic symptoms were little more than an act meant to manipulate the world about me. 

When I pointed out that I had many long-term friendships, which pretty much precluded borderline altogether, even then, I was ignored. Everything I did was seen through the lens of manipulation, including all my attempts to be treated rightly. It was maddening. 

The three family members arrived in a group. I did not walk them in. I waited in the conference room, silently, afraid to betray anything to the doctor and the psychologist that might get me deeper into the tar pit. Chuck walked in first, followed by my folks, who abruptly ended what looked like a quiet argument as they entered. 

My mother and father, who both worked in different wards at that hospital, had visited me often. Because they worked there, the staff would let them in whenever they wanted, and my parents doted on me when they came in, which only served to confirm my therapist’s theory. So as dad and mom walked in, there seemed to be little discomfort in the way they carried themselves. This was their turf, and nothing would shock them here.

The session started hard. “I want you all to know that I believe Mason is faking his symptoms,” said the therapist. “We’re quite sure this is an act.”

“Is that true?” Chuck asked.

“I have let myself fall apart if that’s what you mean.”

“I knew it!” Chuck shouted.

Only later would I realize that this bit was a trap. The doctors were quite sure there was something seriously wrong with me, even if it was only severe borderline symptoms. Baiting the family to see if they dismissed my obvious plight let the team know how they really felt under the sympathy.

“Why?” my mother asked. She was crying. I couldn’t tell for how long. I hadn’t been watching her. “Why would you fake this!”

“You didn’t fucking listen to me,” I said, my tone heightening in intensity. “I am not faking it. I did give myself over to this monster in me, but I didn’t do it for show, God damn it. I did it because I couldn’t fucking fight it anymore.”

Chuck was shifting in his chair, his foot shaking the table with its nervous, rhythmic twitching. My mother covered her face and slipped deeper into weeping. Only my dad remained calm, but this coolness was chillingly inappropriate. 

He broke his silence after a long pause settled between us all. “Mason is very sick. I believe the best course of action is to do what we’ve always done. He should be released to our home where we can nurse him back to health.”

“Dr. Dennis, all respect intended, but that has never really worked before, now has it?” Dr. Wynne said, speaking for the first time since he’d been in the room with me. “What makes you think it will work this time?”

My father is a sucker for credentials, and Dr. Wynne had incredible ones. He had gone to Oxford, remember, and had also worked at the most intensive hospital for the criminally insane in the United Kingdom before retiring to a quiet practice in this small city. 

Had my doctor been just about anyone else, my dad would have tried to argue this point. I believe he knew that Dr. Wynne would not only outflank him but that it might be in my best interest for another doctor to decide my fate this time.

“In my years working with the criminals with mental illnesses in England, I met a lot of men with messiah complexes. These are often deadly. They let the afflicted justify anything in the name of their Godhood. Yet among all these men, Mason has the most entrenched case of a messiah complex I’ve ever seen.” 

I swear to God he said this. 

“He is one of very few who claims to have felt his psychosis for as long as he can remember. There is little hope that he will ever get better without extreme measures. My recommendation is drastic. I want you all to decide on it. Mason has known about it for a few days. I want his answer and yours.”

“What are you getting at? Maybe Mason really is possessed,” my mom said softly.

“I have considered that possibility as well,” my dad said, embarrassed and blushing.

“I have significant connections at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. I want Mason there. I care too much about your family to offer anything less.”

“He is not going that far from us,” my mother said.

“I trust you, Dr. Wynne,” said my father. “But I also trust you enough to feel you really can handle this.”

“I guess I’m not going,” I said.

“Mason! We’re not telling you what to do. It is up to you.”

There are moments in life where seemingly minor decisions change the course of everything. This was not one of those. The decision seemed significant, and it was. I said a quick prayer and then spoke: “I won’t go. I have too much work to do here.”

Dr. Wynne looked at Joyce, and the two seemed very close to each other at that moment, as if there were nothing that could make them disagree on a prognosis. 

The rest of the meeting was a discussion of my upcoming release and the logistics of it. We talked about putting me in an adult foster home, but I rejected that as well. I refused just about every treatment they suggested until I got what I wanted. 

When the commands stopped for a few more days – they hadn’t, but the treatment team thought that they had – I would be given over to one of my friends in AA until I could get on my feet—with zero help from family. This was considered a brutal challenge, but one that I would have to try before anything more drastic was done. 

When my family left, the two people treating me stayed for a little while. At first, there was silence. Then, for the first time, I heard melted sympathy in Joyce’s voice. “We are so, so sorry, Mason.”

Somehow, I knew exactly what her compassion was for. Now that they had seen how enmeshed and toxic my family was, their estimation of my chances of recovery had dropped very low, very quickly. Mine fell too, in my heart, hitting its bottom and shaking my soul. 

Suddenly, I knew the blackest of despair. I was horribly sick and being kept that way, by my family and by my treatment team. There was no exit, either. There was only the hell of godhood and then hell for that presumption. If I had a gun, I would have shot myself then. 

Yet, I have learned how to fake healing. I have had dozens of practice runs. So, I smiled, told a meaningless joke, and smiled again, and laughed long and hard, each peal of it echoed by the Dark Lord inside me.

## Chapter 13

The phone is a crucial line of connection to the world outside the Unit. I had been to such wards enough times to have taken up an everyday habit to prepare for hospitalizations – I made every effort to memorize numbers that I thought would be important, usually by just not putting them in my phone. 

Still, many of my friends were in distant cities.  It was something of a hassle to call long distance. That left me only two local friends, or at least two friends who took their Roosevelt cell phone numbers with them when they moved out of town. Those two had to put up with an awful lot. I was psychotic enough that, at times, I could not stop talking even when I wanted to. There was always something more to say.

Each of these men was close to every member of my family and functioned like honorary brothers to us all. Had they not been so entwined in with the rest of the Dennises, neither would have put up with all that they put up with. My own brothers were not returning my frequent calls very often, but Devin and Brad were there and answering.

“Hey sugar beet,” Devin answered when I called.

“You know I’m sweet. Can you see the Golden Gate Bridge from where you are right now?”

“No but I can see Chinatown.”

“Tourist-tastic! How’s fog life?”

“These moves always make me realize you never really go anywhere. Not if you are who you are. You are just yourself with a different background behind you.”

“That’s almost as depressing as being here.”

“When are you getting out?”

Devin asked me this every time we spoke. It didn’t matter how many times I explained that it’s very hard to estimate that, especially when you’re under a court order, pending though mine was, to stay in treatment.

“If I knew that I would know tomorrow’s lottery numbers, too.”

“This is all standard for you. I mean you’ve been hospitalized twice since we started playing together. It goes fast, right?”

“Not when you tell the truth about what’s really going on in your head.”

“What did you say now, Mason?”

I inhaled deeply and then sighed.

“I told them that I am God the father, come back to Earth to save humankind from itself.”

“What the living fuck man?” This is the first time in the eight years I had known Devin that I heard him get mad at anyone but one of his girlfriends. “Stop with this nonsense. God doesn’t exist. You do. Oh, fuck, this is some real Roosevelt nonsense.”

Devin and I had been playing music off and on since shortly after I had moved home from New York City, in May of 2006. In that year and a half, Devin had moved without me three times, once to Southern California, once to New York City, and finally to San Francisco, where he was taking my calls from the hospital. 

Life had not gone well in any of these places, and in each case, Devin’s heavy drinking was mostly to blame. As we talked more on more often, it became clear that for a third time, Devin was going to be coming back home from his adventure broke and despondent. I believe part of why he justified the third escape was to come home and look after me. 

Even though he was five years younger than I was, Devin spent quite a bit of our time together looking after me – whether that meant tuning my guitar or budgeting our trips for distant shows. Yet when it came time to take these trips, Devin would get messed up, and it would be up to me to take on the helping role and keep everything together. It was hard to tell whether we were great or terrible for each other. Either way, we were always there for each other.

As it became increasingly clear that Joyce and Dr. Wynne were going to release me and let me have a shot at making it without my family, about ten days in, I found out Devin would be home any day. We agreed that he would be the one to pick me up from the hospital. There was no way those treating me would allow a family member to do so. 

The longer I stayed there, the harder Joyce drove home the point that it was my dependence on my family that had led me to a life of learned helplessness. I got a cookie every time I lost my mind, and so I kept losing my mind to get more cookies. Life was easier but less healthy for me when I was not independent of my parents. Over and over, this was driven home. It had occurred to me before I went in, especially that my dependence made me feel worse. I just did not know how to get around that, and so I went through it, pain and all.

Brad, my other phone victim, had played a crucial role in both of my attempts at independence in the preceding year. Both of these attempts had ended in disaster. Brad owned the old lumber mansion in downtown Roosevelt. We called it Houndstooth Manor, after our record label, or, more commonly, just the Manor. 

He had bought it in the summer of 2006 in hopes that he would be able to rent it out as a four-bedroom unit and cover the mortgage that way. I had organized a group of renters, but living there had not worked out. 

That time ended in violent confrontations and the place losing three of the five renters to other situations. Worse still, one of the two who stayed never paid. Seven months later, I tried to move in with a new group, but it became the scene of the relapse that ended my five years of sobriety. Again, renters were lost, and again, the ones who remained didn’t pay.

As a result of all this drama, Brad and I had a strained relationship. But in all that chaos it was impossible to suss out what had been my fault, and what had been his fault, and what had been bad luck, and we were mature enough to share the blame. 

Both of us, I suspect, would have felt even more guilty if we had let the Manor ruin our friendship. He and I had been close off and on since I was sixteen. After my graduation party, he had taken me out to eat at three in the morning. Partway through college, he had come with my family to the Bahamas for the turn of the millennium. 

Brad is an intensely likable man who can win confidence in minutes even as he comes off as a bit off. Such charm in the face of eccentricity is rare but easy to enjoy. So though he had come into our family through a close friendship with my sister, he was bound to me as well. 

Brad was even closer to Chuck, serving as a sort of mentor. The two of them, at once kooky and comely, made a great team. Above all, Brad was both easy to talk to and understanding of madness, which made him the perfect call.

I did not bother him with the grisly details - the mouthy man who was beaten into his room by security guards, for example. Instead, we distracted ourselves from such scary situations by talking business. 

Our company was Houndstooth Media. We had released an EP and an LP, both of which had met with acclaim from prominent bloggers, and one of which had sold well enough to break even. Yet looking down the barrel of our third release, it was clear that something was wrong. 

Biff, our business manager, claimed to know nothing of where the money had gone and had also moved to Chicago just when it all had come in. Already being paranoid from the schizophrenia, this reason to be suspicious was enough for me to be enraged. 

Usually, I am slow to anger, but the incident with my brother and parents seemed to have left open a gate containing my rage, and it would come out with little resistance. It was fortunate for our business that I did not have Biff’s phone number memorized. As a result, Brad bore the brunt of my angry fear and did very well considering.

It wasn’t merely non-delusional paranoia that Brad and I discussed. I seemed to have a brilliant new idea every day. I came up with a new computer interface that circumvented a keyboard and a mouse. It involved a glove with a heavy base that tracked the hand’s movements to send out text and move a cursor. I drew extensive schematics with markers on a legal pad.

Then I designed a remodel for the Manor that turned it into a bar and music venue. I pressed that we incorporate Houndstooth in a Caribbean country so that we’d have to pay no taxes. 

Most impressively, I invented an encryption system that was bizarre and easy to break but led to hilarious results, like Pig Latin, only funnier. The language, which I dubbed Truish, followed this pattern – first words were cut into syllables. Next, a homonym was found for each syllable. Finally, a synonym was found for each homonym. The homonyms and synonyms were loose but standardized. Here is an example:

English: I am here.

Homonyms: Eye end hear.

Truish: Cornea finish listen.

After I came up with it, I wrote essays and schematics only in Truish, increasingly afraid that my significant breakthroughs would be stolen by a staff member or another patient. To me, the code had to be difficult to break, and I thought all of the plans and thoughts were equally crucial to the course of human history. 

This, after the messiah complex was starting to recede – I still thought I would save the world; only now it was by my hard work instead of some mystical destiny. I sometimes wish my mother had not told me that I could be anything that I wanted when I grew up.

All of these thoughts, plus a thousand and one tweaks to the existing Houndstooth website and business plan, poured onto Brad’s ears as he traveled for work. He, after all, had a fairly lucrative day job, selling neurosurgical equipment. Without a wife or family, he had resources ready to invest, if any of my schemes made sense. 

Still, as generous as he was when taking people out to eat, he ardently guarded his money and was almost as concerned as I was about the missing profits from the second release on our label. Brad has a paranoid streak, too,  favoring studies of conspiracy theories and worrying that he was being screwed over at every turn, but he wasn’t paranoid enough to encrypt his writings.

When I told Devin about Truish, he only laughed. I laughed, too. When he would laugh at me, I always took it as understanding, not derisive. That laugh was a keynote of Devin’s charm. The days were nearing that he would return, that I would get out and that I would be able to deal with the Houndstooth mystery. 

Still, there was only one challenge keeping me back – I had nowhere to lay my head when I got out. Yet problems of such an urgent nature paled before my means to greatness. I was trying to thrive when I could not yet survive. The direness hadn’t set in. I worked on in blissful shock, sure I would never go homeless. I could not see that future.

## Chapter 14

Dr. Wynne was tall, with a jerky walk and a hunched neck. He favored blazers with patches on the sleeves and slacks that barely matched, if they matched at all. When he stuck his head into a therapy room to call a patient into his office, he always said, “May I have a word with you?” as if there were any choice about it, as if he needed our permission, as if we were free. Ten days into my stay at the Behavioral Health Unit, he made just such a request. 

By that time, I had been going to group therapy for a few days. It started when I discovered how beautiful the motion therapy leader was. She looked about 22, perhaps four or five years younger than I was. Her red hair matched her eyebrows and freckles. I would sit next to her as she led us in mild exercises, and at times, graze her arm with my palm as I raised it or lowered it according to her movement. 

At first, she would back away a few inches from these apparently incidental contacts, but after a while, she just went with it. One morning before she came in, I drew an unmistakable likeness of her on the dry-erase board. I pity this therapist now, having to deal with games like mine, or games even worse. I was at the punchline of a joke, and she was smiling when Dr. Wynne stuck his barely coated skull of a head into the room to take me to our one on one session.

I followed his bony sort of canter to his office.  He walked like a colt that hadn’t grown into its legs. On a shelf behind him, he had two shelves of books about psychopathology that I hadn’t read. If the old doctor across from me was to be believed, though, I did not have psychotic bipolar disorder, I had been mistreated my whole time under the care of others, and I was only now being handled rightly. 

He handed me discharge paperwork and asked me what I thought of getting out that day. I ignored his offer of freedom and instead focused on the diagnosis at the top of the follow-up treatment plan. “I have psychosis not otherwise specified. What does that even mean?”

“I don’t entirely know, Mr. Dennis. The truth is that we should keep you somewhere for a very, very long time the way you are even now. Unfortunately, it is difficult to finance a long term stay and, more to the point, this is a short-term facility anyhow. No, you may not be ready. You may not ever be ready if your history of these messianic delusions is to be believed. What I’m giving you here is a chance – a chance I’m sure you’ll love to take – I’m giving you a chance to prove me wrong.”

“You don’t think I’ll make it?”

“I didn’t say that, Mr. Dennis, at least not exactly. It would be negligent, nay criminal, for me to release you if you were still dangerous. That part is over. Whether or not you will ever join society as an independent man is what I am challenging you to answer for yourself.”

At this point, a knock split the pause settling between the doctor and me. It was Joyce. As she stepped in and then took a seat close to Dr. Wynne, I could feel the whole room cool down and dry out. This situation felt like the skin of a shark out of water - dangerous if approached the wrong way. “I suppose you can’t tell me what Psychosis Not Otherwise Specified means either.”

“Good morning to you, too, Mason.” She switched the way her legs were crossed with graceful delicacy as if she were dancing in her chair. I had unsettled her, but still, she was keeping her composure.

“I was briefing Mr. Dennis on his discharge plan,” Dr. Wynne croaked.

“Actually, it was more of a motivational speech,” I said.

Dr. Wynne got cross then, cross in a way he only seemed to when we were around Joyce. It was as if any levity or sarcasm or even reference to culture high or low was an affront to his dignity that his ego could only take in private.

“Must this be a joke?” asked the doctor. Then he and the therapist gave each other a look that said something between only the two of them. It was at that exact moment that I became certain that the two of them were lovers outside of this place. 

Months later, when I learned that this was the case from gossip around town, I shook my fist at the sky and cursed my burden. Dr. Wynne was always reasonable and respectful when only the two of us were in a room. Once in a while, he even laughed at a particularly apt reference. 

With her, though, he never so much as chuckled. What little warmth he was capable of mustering frosted over, and I had a hard case to deal with.

“If I don’t laugh at this shit, I’ll cry.”

“That might be more appropriate considering what you’re facing,” the therapist said. Her doctor turned and gazed at her with a flash of ardor and adoration. I felt their intimacy even then. “Our main worry,” she continued, “is that you’ll become suicidal when you realize what you’re facing.”

“I thought the court shit was suspended.”

“It hasn’t been dismissed,” she said, “and you will have to get by without any help from your family for the first time in your life.”

“I’ve been on my own before,” I said.

“Really?” she asked, talking down in tone.

“The summer of 2001. I paid my own rent and bills.”

“And how long did that last?” she asked.

“A few months.”

Dr. Wynne interjected, cutting off Joyce while placing a hand on her arm tenderly to restrain her with apparent love. He said, “How did that feel, Mr. Dennis? To be independent?”

I thought then of those warm and dry months – living and working in Ann Arbor, chasing a great girl I never got, going to shows and parties as if I had invented those functions – everything new and free – and smiled.

“It was the best time of my life.”

“Well, we hope you can do that again,” the doctor said.

“You are to attend all your appointments with CMH. You are not to leave the county without notifying us. You are absolutely not to live with any family member. You are to live with your friend from AA. Is all that understood?”

“Better than you can understand it,” I said straight to Joyce.

She winced and blinked and then continued. “Your nurse will go over the details of your discharge. When you can find a ride – not family - you can leave. I wish you the best,” she said. That last line crawled out of her against her will, I could tell.

“This is goodbye, Mason.” I stood and shook his hand and hers and gave them a broad, creepy, exuberant smile.

“At least, we hope it’s goodbye,” Joyce said as she curtly shut the door and turned to block its window with her back.

I should have called the AA friend who was taking me in. He was kind enough to make up a room for me. I owed him at least an acknowledgment for his generosity, even if I were not to take him up on his offer. But at that moment, my mind was stuck in escape mode, and living with a middle-aged businessman north of North Roosevelt sounded like the kind of situation that would have made me as suicidal as the treatment team feared that I could become. So, I thought up a story right there, a lie that I would ride for the next few days. I called Devin.

“Hey. I was talking to a friend in the program, and he said the man who was taking me in is a pedophile.”

“Where are you going to go?”

“Well, they need to think that I’m off to his house, but really I don’t know.” At that point, I ardently hoped Devin would offer me a bedroom in his parent’s mansion, but he wasn’t about to cross that boundary.

“What about the Manor?”

I did still have a key to it, and no one was living there. I had not talked to Brad about staying there, but the place was empty, and I was sure he would let me take a room there until I could get on my feet and pay him. But I already owed him two months’ rent from previous stays, so it could go either way.

“Good thinking. That will do.”

“What time should I spring you?”

“Oh, let’s say high noon, cowboy.”

“Saddle up.”

And with that, it was only a matter of him getting my car from my parents. I imagined him taking the lovely walk between his house and theirs. Perhaps an eagle would call his attention skyward, and then that Japanese man down the road would come by with his whippet on a leash. 

I too would soon be able to walk more than halls. 

It is worth noting that my psychosis had not lifted. In fact, it had worsened. I was at that moment absolutely convinced that I was God. This release was granted that I might fulfill my glorious destiny. The chatter from the Dark Lord, which was frequent, only shadowed from the brilliance of the glory that was due to me. However, you specified it, this was psychosis.

I thought then of what Joyce had told me a week ago: “Mason, if you know you’re hallucinating, then you’re not hallucinating.” 

This had made no sense until just then. I was not hallucinating. The Dark Lord was real. I was just hallucinating, though.

## Chapter 15

## Chapter 22

Devin’s September  migration back from California by bus took nearly a week. 

He arrived in Roosevelt the same day I was first released from the Unit and barely went home before coming to pick me up. I should have known he’d step off the Greyhound almost as mad as me.  There was always some intangible danger behind his wide eyes. Sometimes it spread beyond, and you could feel it radiate. When I saw him waiting in the parking lot, he had that laser-vision look on. 

Something was going to burn.

The late September day was lovely and also poignant because of the approaching coldness. Only a slice of the leaves was turning. Most shone as green as if it were July. Still, there was a smell to the air like a musty sweater that made the season unmistakable. 

I had not seen more of the world than the views from my window or from the courtyard. At that tenuous time, the continuing order of treatment had been suspended, pending my adherence to a treatment plan. 

I was to live with a friend from AA. I was to make all follow-up appointments at Community Mental Health. I was not to live with any member of my family. I was to quit my job working for my father. I was to get another job and work my way toward self-sufficiency. It seemed, if not easy, then at least straightforward. 

I still had a car, which Devin had driven from my parents’ house to pick me up. They had filled the back with all of my things of any importance, neatly folded and boxed, before he took it. The sense of liberation I felt swelling through me, with everything I needed with me and ready to go anywhere, cannot be overstated. 

I was already exuberant when I was in the hospital; this freedom made me much more so. I got into the car and grabbed my friend's hand to shake, and he yelped like a rebel. There was a country station playing loud, something ancient and bouncy, and it seemed like we were gearing up for a car chase in a buddy comedy. 

It was only a matter of time before the happy ending.

“There’s only one place to go on a day like this!” I said. “The Beach!” It was early afternoon, and the day was at the height of its heat. As we barreled through the ghetto surrounding the hospital, banjos bleating through tinny speakers, I laughed maniacally, and Devin did too. 

The traffic melted before us, leaving a smooth sail down the expressway that separates poor Roosevelt Heights from not-so-poor Roosevelt Shores. Every light was coming up green. There was nothing to stop me anymore.

“How was your trip?” I asked.

“You don’t want to know,” he said.

“How long did it take?”

“Six days.”

“I don’t know how you do shit like that,” I said.

“I just do it.”

Devin jammed down the accelerator to make the last cut he needed to hit the side streets of our suburb. Roosevelt Shores was so thickly hung with associations and memories that they overwhelmed each other, a crowd of reminiscences shouting at once until nothing could be remembered. 

We turned off onto a forested curve along the south shore of Koma Lake, where relative wealth stood stacked behind long driveways shrouded with trees. 

My parent’s home was on this road, further down it, closer to Lake Michigan but off the waterfront proper. I had been living there for a year, and it had felt like a trap the whole time. Now that I could not go back, those memories seemed sweeter somehow. 

What cannot be recaptured can feel worth capturing only after that is no longer an option. 

It was only a short turn, and then an s-curve between giant, grassy dunes, and we were at the parking lot for Lake Bay Park. It was a Thursday. School was in session. People were at work. The parking lot that would have been full a month before was empty except for our car.

Usually on warm fall days, approaching the Lake makes everything much, much colder. By late September, its waters were almost always too cold for swimming, cold enough that everything near them was colder as well. But that afternoon, the air seemed to warm as we neared the water. 

There was no one to be seen on the shore. In another town, this might have been strange, but Roosevelt’s beaches are, at the right times, empty as a city after it has been hit by a neutron bomb. The town’s industrial waterfront and intense, urban poverty made tourists wary. The result was beautiful. You could be alone in wild splendor, like a wayward Native, like a polar bear.

Lake Michigan had the choppy surface that is typical for fall. I had been wearing flip-flops since before I had been in the hospital. I kicked these off, my toes squeaking like cornered shrews, the sand swallowing them. I didn’t even bother pulling up my jeans. I just stepped in, expecting to be shocked, but was shocked instead by the comfort I found in the water.

“How is it?” Devin asked, shouting over the surf.

“Apple pie!”

I walked back to dry sand and took off my shirt. Devin did the same. We both looked scrawny and underfed. I looked to the sky and let out a yelp of my own. We stripped to our boxers. I turned back to the water and saw a sole head bobbing in its water, a short man playing like a child. Devin and I gave each other a look, and then we ran in.

There is a refreshment that is unique to jumping through freshwater waves. The spray smacks your face and into your mouth and seems as if it could be swallowed safely. There is no chlorine sting or salty stink. People around Western Michigan talk about this feeling of entering the lake the way a teenage boy might brag about the first time he entered a girl. There is that kind of joy and release to it.

I looked to my right, and Devin was laughing in heaves and then spinning, his arms helicopter blades and his soul bound to fly at any time. I looked to my left, and the bobbing head was near. It belonged to a bald, furrowed man. He glowed with as much joy as my friend, looking carefree. 

Still, there was a surety to his joy that made it look more serene than ours. He looked as though there was not a thing he regretted in his long, long life. Then he turned and headed toward us. I looked back at Devin and motioned toward the man. The two of us began to head toward him as well.

When we met, he spoke first, his voice thick and soft as suede. 

“I just wanted to see who else was crazy enough to be out here in September.”

“Crazy is a strong word,” I said.

He ignored this comment. “They told me I won’t live through the winter. They told me it’s cancer. This is my last swim.”

“I’m glad we could be a part of it,” I said.

“You know, I’ve always wanted to walk all the way through the channel. I think I’ll do that now. Goodbye.”

“Go with God,” I said. I often wished people off that way, but this time it struck something.

“Did you know I was a preacher?”

“Oh, he treats them all that way,” Devin said.

We all laughed, and the man swam off. The arms of the channel into Koma Lake were metal and rusted and hung perhaps fifty feet out into the Lake. We were all out far past that, at a sandbar, bobbing with the waves’ first break. 

The dying man had only to turn a certain way toward shore. As he left us, a feeling of faith swelled in me, as if there were some grand purpose to this encounter. 

Devin must have felt it, too. I looked at him long, hoping he would get my point. He laughed again. I laughed again. 

Then he looked straight at me and said, “I still don’t believe in God, Mason.” 

We laughed even more.

We capered around for a few more minutes as if playing like children could bring back opportunities that were no longer ours. After the revelry, we headed in. I got my clothes back on, and my skin chafed beneath them, but the annoyance was a reminder of its cause, and so wasn’t much of a nuisance at all. On the walk back to the car, a path along the channel, we looked to our right, and there was the dying preacher swimming down the center of the channel, just like his dream.

Devin lived only a short distance from that park. We split another hearty handshake, and then we were out of my old Japanese sedan, trotting to the garage of his mansion, shoes and socks in hand. I looked at the massive home and was overwhelmed with sadness. I had no home. 

With everything with me, I had nowhere to go, and for the first time, I felt this. 

The chafing kept up as I turned out of the driveway with no idea where I was going, and it was suddenly sad to feel the wetness on my skin. There would be no swimming in my near future. The following day, the current would turn, chilling the Lake and ending the summer.

## Chapter 16

Even before my swirl down the toilet and into what I then considered to be the wastewater system of community mental health, I had to learn some painful lessons about helping my fellows with psychiatric conditions.

Never invite a six-foot four, two-hundred-fifty pound recovering crack addict Satanist to be your roommate. Never give a pansexual compulsively lying male exotic dancer a room in the same house. If you do both, don’t be surprised when their MDMA selling enterprise ends with the Satanist blowing all the profits on crack. And when you have to kick them out, don’t be surprised when the Satanist puts a seven thousand year old Chaldean demon into you that makes you want to kill your family.

Devin had dropped me off after our swim, and I was standing on the larger of the two front porches of Houndstooth Manor, the house where I lived with Redd the Satanist and Louis the dancer, key to the house in hand.

I have only told of the bad times in the Manor. It was not all destitution, drugs, and demonology.  The story of Louis and Redd was only one infected part in the flesh of the life in that house, like a cold sore returning to the lip of a great beauty. And like a cold sore, the infection was persistent.

Perhaps its incurable nature had something do with the little ghost who haunted the place.

Having spoken with spirits, the supernatural was a natural part of life to me. Through dealing with ghosts of tortured philosophers and religious figures, I had hardened to the point that the supposed wrath of some sickly girl who died in the house over a hundred years before seemed innocuous. 

Little translucent girls in old houses are not nearly as scary as, say,  the time I heard Nietzsche’s voice straight from hell. 

The Manor was a haunted nineteenth-century Victorian mansion, still solid on her timbers of good old Michigan white pine.  It was painted a grayish maroon with accents in pale yellow and brown, and had hardwood floors that would make a home-makeover show host drool. 

In the Manor’s rooms, Devin and I wrote and practiced songs.  Over its tables, Brad, Biff, and I drafted a more equitable music industry from our dreams.  There were low brow hijinx and high flown notions of altruistic art.  There were parties for house shows and CD releases.  There were parties for any reason and for no reason at all. The Manor: the name still overwhelms me with cognitive dissonance - simultaneous thoughts and of joy and pain.

But now, in my hour of need, it was dark and empty.  

After all of the fiascos, Brad was leery of leasing out the Manor again, so by September 2007, the rental property stood empty. I still had a key, however, and now out of the hospital, I planned to squat there until I thought up a better plan.

It had been a very long day.  I had awoken in the hospital around two AM that morning, according to my habit there, and so I’d had almost a day’s worth of waiting before my beach adventure with Devin.  It felt like living three different lives, and I was wiped out by eight. With the light nearly gone in the sky, it didn’t feel strange to head back to the Manor and get sleep. When I walked in, the first thing I did was look for a mattress. 

I found one in the spooky basement. Its stone darkness felt as horrifying as a slasher film -- upsetting as a jump scare but easy to dismiss with a bit of rational analysis. With some awkward twists through narrow spaces, I managed to bring what had been a futon cushion up to the first floor. It was then only a matter of waiting to sleep.

I had a hard time, but that was a result of my low dose of medication. I had been released with an even lower dose of the antipsychotic Seroquel than I had been taking before my admission. That made no sense. The only times when I had earnestly improved, beginning to doubt my godhood, were the weekends when Dr. Wynne was off, and I could get my drug tripled. 

Looking back on it, my release at that point was foolhardy. 

A decent human being of a doctor would never release a patient with the psychotic symptoms I had been displaying.  Even if he was ninety-nine percent sure that I was faking my symptoms to get attention, the seriousness of the single percent chance that I wasn’t should have given him pause.  He was acting on the Junior High School level theory behind mental illness – that people could just suck it up and stop being so needy, and they would all be okay. I could not have done anything but failed.

Without much medication, sleep barely came and ended again around two AM when I burst off the mattress with the energy of a wind-up toy. 

Off then, I spun to an all-night diner. There I sat and ate and looked at my watch frequently, one that a fellow patient had given this watch to me while I had been in the hospital. Besides fooling the staff, my lies had the somewhat more credible effect of making me seem like an example of healing to the other patients. I was able to counsel and console him without discrediting myself. The watch's hands did not move faster, no matter how hard I tried to use my godlike powers on them. I had a journal and a pen and spent a few hours pounding coffee and working out a few elaborate drawings, wishing I had a set of markers to really make the sketches come alive.

The plan to return to the Manor was short-lived. 

As my flip phone buzzed in my hand, the autumn sun was starting to get higher over Brick Street, casting long shadows across the porch. Facing west at my lengthened silhouette, I looked to the phone and saw Brad’s name flashing. It was a call like a job interview screening; I knew the outcome might be a drastic change of my fortunes one way or another. After swimming with Devin, I had texted Brad asking to crash in his empty investment property for free until I got on my feet. Then I slept there without permission. Now, the following morning, I was about to get my answer by voice.

“You are not living in my house. I already have it on my head that you relapsed there. And you owe me two months’ rent and need another month too if you’re going to get in.”

“So you’re worried about what my family will think?”

“Of course I am.”

I snorted and wondered if he could hear as much.

“But really this is about money, like every problem I have with my family is at root.”

“I never want another squatter in that place again. Not even you. Especially not you. What happens if something bad happens again?”

“I’m not going to kill myself in your house if that’s what you’re worried about.”

“We’re done, Mason. Get a job and some money together, and we can talk. Or find another scheme.”

I ended the call and scrolled through my contacts, looking for any name anywhere to take me in. 

I went a long way through names before I got to Vinh Minh. Vinh had been my best friend for most of my life. We had met just over twenty years before, in early September of 1987. Our childhood, our adolescence, our newly adult years we had always been close, save for a six month feud in 1990 whose origins neither of us could remember. If there was anyone I considered closer than family, it was Vinh.

At that time, Vinh was living in a house he had bought some months before. I knew he would make up the basement for me, at least. The only issue logistically was that he lived in Clawson, one of the more pleasant suburbs of Detroit near Royal Oak, and I was required to notify Community Mental Health if I even left the county, let alone moved across the state.

Yet the more I thought about it, the more Detroit seemed like an option that could work better than Roosevelt. 

There was greater opportunity and definitely more appropriate jobs. The only work in my hometown was service industry slogs that required a temperament more even than mine and industrial shop jobs that were harder and harder to get all the time. I was worse with tools than people and figured my best chance was office work. 

Just before he was probably going into the hospital where he was a resident for the workday, I called Vinh.

“Hey, you know how we always joked that the day would come I would be homeless and have to squat in your basement?”

“Oh Jesus,” said Vinh.

“Yeah, the day has come.”

“One favor. Olivia is coming over tonight for date night. Better if I tell her you’re going to be living with me in person. So you can’t come until tomorrow afternoon. You have somewhere else to go until then? Anywhere?”

“Ty’s not far, Ann Arbor. But I’m not supposed to be around my family right now. Really ever again. Doctor’s orders.”

“A little time with Ty can’t get you in too much trouble. Don’t you have to call CMH and clear the move with them?”

“Why must you be so clinical,Vinh?”

“Because I’m a fucking doctor. Got to go, the chief resident almost saw me smoking. I had to duck in my car. See you tomorrow.”

“Text me your address so I can Mapquest it at Ty’s.”

“Oh yeah, you haven’t been here yet. I forgot. I will. Later.”

Feeling somewhat triumphant, I thought of heading to an AA meeting to share my plan. 

I had not been to one in almost two weeks. Ordinarily, I don’t like to go to fewer than five a week. When I don’t, I get irritable. I was already on edge from my mental condition, and what can work as group therapy seemed like a necessary step. 

Roosevelt AA was a better sort of group therapy than the hospital because people down there knew me and had known me for almost ten years. I would find more than support; I would find understanding, a rare feeling when as mad as I was. Even turning into the parking lot, I was filled with a sense of relief. That relief only intensified when I walked in and saw the usual crowd, some of whom were new friends, some of whom friends older than most in my life. I felt at home. I wished I could have slept there.

Back before my hospitalization, the last meeting I had attended had been directed mostly at me. I had shared my family issues and called that as a topic, focusing everyone on that subject for the next hour or so. I shared the deep rage directed at them that was bubbling up from my unconscious as commands to kill them all. Sharing a desire to commit violent crime is relatively frequent at meetings, but usually, it is easy to tell that such references aren’t serious. 

Once, though, a man shared about wanting to kill his wife for perhaps a month and then killed his wife, and no one had alerted anyone. The privacy of an AA meeting can be more protective of dangerous feelings than any therapist. We do not have a duty to warn down at the club. Still, after the murder, people began to take the kind of sharing I was doing as a potential legal issue. 

That my compulsion to kill arose from an inscrutable mental illness only made other members more nervous.

Nevertheless, as I returned now after very nearly succumbing to that sick violence, I found profound compassion from most everyone. I felt a real, unconditional sense of love that I had not in the hospital, even from my parents. 

AA is like that.

As I stood in the parking lot of the church converted into an AA club, the sun climbing over wide lawns to the east, a thought that would eventually save my life occurred to me. In AA, it is often said, and by outsiders often derided, that alcoholism is a spiritual malady. In order to get reprieve from chronic alcohol abuse, your spirituality is the first priority. Once that is sorted out, the mental aspects of your problem fall into place.

I had casually posited before that the principles of AA could help treat severe mental health conditions. A spiritual approach to my problem, my messiah complex, seemed especially pertinent. What if I were to add language about my symptoms of psychosis to my alcoholism-focused prayers, a core of my recovery from alcohol abuse?

As fast as the thought had come, it was replaced by noise, voices threatening my family, rose up within me, and l for the time being, they shoved aside the plan that would later revolutionize the way I treated my psychosis. Painful as life had been, it wasn’t yet painful enough. 

Still I kept stepping toward my rock bottom, devil astride.

## Chapter 17

Against my better judgment, out of a masochistic sense of duty, I called the father with whom I was supposed to have no contact and told him I was moving to Detroit.

An avalanche of questions followed fast, and a demand to meet before I left for an early dinner. 

As my father rattled on, the Dark Lord came to life and jawed at me, the usual murderous and messianic prattle. This continued as I went about a day with nowhere in Roosevelt to stay, hopping from meeting to coffee shop and back again. My AA friends said my plan to move made sense considering everything and said they would miss me, with a few emotional goodbyes and more general well wishes.

By five PM, I sat on the roof of one of the newer bars in Roosevelt. The south shore of Agawatta Lake stretched from one horizon and almost touched the other one. Past it, the north shore of this lake was a thin branch of green bamboo. 

It all might have been beautiful in a pure sense were it not for industrial tanks littering the shore and the distant smokestacks towering at either end of the lake. As it was, piles of coal and all, the waterfront held its own tragically scarred beauty, like an aging actress whose plastic surgery is showing more and more as years pass. It was not natural, but the blots of industry showed the life it once had.

At a corner table on the roof deck, my parents, their best friend, and I finished a late dinner. The food was bland, but the hospital had given me an appreciation for any kind of quality, dull or not. 

It had been an unseasonably splendid day, 28 September 2007. The deck felt like summer but smelled like fall. Only a few of the trees around were showing that it was autumn. Indian Summer days always felt like weddings to me: the last parties before everything got boring.

My parents’ lives were usually somewhat dull in the best way. I had changed that for them, but their friend was going smoothly on with his. He, Morgan, happened to be the CEO of the hospital where I had been housed until the previous afternoon. He was retiring and preparing to move to Georgia, partially because his hospital was merging with another one in town, making him redundant, and partly because he had grandchildren in the South. 

Morgan asked me to rate the customer service of his little place as if he were the manager of a small fast food joint and not the man behind the machine that almost chewed me up. By behind it, I mean only in a Wizard of Oz sense, only for show.

“A bang-up job they did,” I said. “You should be proud of the organization.”

“Are you being sarcastic?” he asked with a wide grin.

After a beat: “I honestly don’t know.”

Everybody laughed, and the subject was changed to my move. I had spent the whole day preparing to move to Detroit. My parents seemed proud of me. The joy for them may well have been a show the way mine was. 

I doubted that my parents were hearing the Dark Lord and his murderous orders. As the Sumerian annoyance prattled on about violence, I did my best to fake health but also realized just how sarcastic I had been with Morgan. 

They had done a terrible job in the Behavioral Health Unit. I was perhaps crazier than I had been upon entering, and I was free and hiding my symptoms, both of which can be very dangerous. That was the state in which I fooled them and the state in which I left them with hugs and headed for my car and the road to Detroit by way of Ann Arbor.

## Chapter 18

Before Ty was an Architecture student at the University of Michigan, it had been my alma mater for my undergraduate Creative Writing degree.  I knew the town well and still had friends in the music scene there.  I had heard of a show happening that night and decided to watch it before I went back to Ty’s. He was studying until late anyway, and I felt no need to head right over to his place. Ty knew I was coming and had a couch ready, and that was enough.

After attending the show, I headed to Ty’s place. He had finished studying partway through the concert and so by the time that I joined him, he was very wet and sloppy. My drunken brother Ty is a loud, pushy creature, really another brother altogether than when he’s sober. And so it was time for me to receive an indignant lecture from my youngest sibling. When I got into trouble, Ty was quick to take the pulpit and preach down at me from it, but he had oratorical skills that made the experience somewhat enjoyable. 

He was not quite in his lecturing mode when I arrived, however. He was blasting cuts from the eighties, studio musician garbage from the Scarface and Karate Kid soundtracks, among other dreck. I cannot remember the source of the particular blaring tune that rang from enormous speakers on his porch, but it was of that ilk, and I hoped he would turn it off. 

I was not in the mood for hipster posturing or drunken antics. That did not particularly matter for a while, though. Just that sort of posturing was what was happening for a good while until I was able to turn down the song and his mood.

I was still in rough shape. Leaving the presence of my parents had quieted the Dark Lord to an extent, and for some reason, my brother’s show of irony had not churned up murderous impulses. Far from Roosevelt, I felt a pleasant sense of distance from the problems that had presented me with such difficulty. 

Everyone in the family had heard stories of the worst, however, and Ty was not able to enjoy himself for long, putting down his fifth of Old Grand-Dad and sitting with me on a couch. Just then, a few of our other mutual friends walked in, joining us from another party. They audited the class Ty was about to teach.

“Mason, you’ve got to realize that everyone hears voices. It is how consciousness works. We have an inner-monologue that can take on different personas. Once in a while, everyone wants horrible things to happen to their parents. That’s also just life.”

“Thinking you’re the Messiah is not,” I said.

“That’s the shit that makes me worry,” Ty said. “You have no right to put that burden on me and the rest of the family.”

“You don’t know a damn thing about this.”

“What?” Ty asked.

“This,” I said, pointing at my head, index finger in the pocket of my right temple.

“Mason, do you ever think you’re not even crazy? That mom and dad overreacted when you were a kid and made you sick? I want to see what would happen if they finally took you off of everything. I want that very badly. It would be hard to do, but if it happened in a hospital, it could work. It would take months, though.”

“If I go back to a hospital,” I said, “it will be for months. There is a court order in suspension that could be taken up and used to commit me indefinitely, with all my decisions in the hands of my doctors.”

“You never need to go to the hospital. You never have. You need to learn what you really are.”

“Ty, the damage is done. The damage is fucking done. I dream about going off, but it is never going to happen. I need the drugs if for no other reason than that my body is so used to them.”

Ty spit, then, as he did when nervous and pausing, spit on his own dingy wood floor and then spread it around with his right foot until there was nothing left but a slight shine to the boards.

“You’re not God,” Ty said. “Bottom line. Let’s move on.” He walked back to the stereo then, playing “Gloria” and flying around the room.

Later that night, we sat down, and I showed him the considerable amount of writing that I did in the hospital, as well as the drawings and doodles that had kept my mind busy when it was raging with hate. 

Ty loved my visual art. He and my mother were the only ones who seemed to. And so, I was able to bask in some sense of appreciation after the hard words we had shared. The night drove on into the morning, Ty drinking the whole way and only getting louder until he passed out a few hours after sun up. I had come to a place to get better where everyone stayed up all night partying. I could think of no worse environment for a man fighting something like mania. 

When I lit out from Ann Arbor, it was with the urgency that usually drove me to hospitals. I hoped that Vinh’s place could be a pleasant sanctuary. I needed one. Every place I had sought such peace had betrayed me, from the hospital to my parents’ home to New York City to my old college town. 

I was glad to leave the undergrad madness. Ty had mentioned something about another show the next day, one that Devin was coming in for, and that perhaps he and I could meet the next day. The idea sounded terrible but tempting. There was no way for me to know just how horrible it would become.

## Chapter 19

I got to Vinh’s house in mid-morning, having killed a few hours at a coffee house so that I would not get there too soon and wake him up. I found him on his soft, stylish couch watching the pregame show for that Saturday’s college football lineup. I sank into the cushion next to his.  Vinh had gone to Michigan State, heated rivals of the University of Michigan, but our friendship and our shared love of football went back long before college. My Wolverines had started that season by losing to Appalachian State, and there was no real way to get over it. He greeted me with a few digs about that game and then offered me coffee.  It was the most homelike and welcome of rituals.  We sat and sipped in comfortable silence for a few minutes before he said:

“Steve is coming over today.”

This could only be one Steve: the Steven of Go In Peace! with Jonathan Stuckey, formerly of a whole chain of failed bands with me, stretching back to high school in the suburbs of Roosevelt.  Steve had been a classmate for years, but he and I had really become friends during a high school choir trip to Europe, where we took advantage of the permissive wine and beer culture to become drinking buddies.  He became Vinh’s friend in turn, and when both of them were at Michigan State, they bonded tightly over weed.

Vinh looked at me, perhaps to gauge my reaction to Steve’s name.

“I haven’t slept,” was all I said.

“Mason, Mason.”

“I’m taking the medication. They just barely have me on any.”

“There’s some Benadryl in my cupboard. Take one and go take a nap,” he said.

I did as the doctor ordered.

When I awakened, it was to the sound of cheers and jeers from Vinh and his guest. 

Notes of triumph or derision in Steve’s voice tweaked me differently than the same notes in Vinh’s.  It was crazy, of course.  Not crazy in the Dark Lord way, but crazy in the way of the petty jealousies of normal people.  There was no reason I should not wish Steve success in all of his ventures.  His greatest venture at the moment was Go In Peace! with Jonathan.  Brad and I were releasing them on Houndstooth.  Their success was our success.  And Steve was dedicated to that success.  He had dropped out of Michigan State with a dissertation almost finished and divorced his wife to leave himself nothing but the music.  Steve’s normal life had committed seppuku for the honor of Steve’s artistic life.  I wasn’t quite comfortable saying that it was worth it because the only thing worth the sacrifice would be complete success, and part of me begrudged him that.

More than once, many times, actually, Steve and I had tried to form a duo or the core of a band, and we always managed to write songs, but the union never lasted. Our stuff was never worth divorcing anyone over, and I myself had left it for writing and graduate school in New York City. When I was gone, Steve gave up on us and focused on his band with Jonathan Stuckey.  They started off slow, playing for no one, getting ignored, and by that summer had worked their way up being paid attention to without much praise. At the same time, Jonathan had assembled a more successful act along the same folkie lines and was touring with them nationally. 

Meanwhile, in New York City, I didn’t end up giving up on music and was finding my way into a much bigger scene.  Steve and Jon seemed to look up to me and hang on my advice. The dynamic had changed since I had come back to Michigan and slowly collapsed before the supernova that was then angrily underway. Now Jon was always circumspect and evasive around me, dodging my attempts to latch onto his success.  Steve began treating me like a less experienced novice in need of his guidance.  Both of us would have liked to think of the other as the small-town friend he’d had to ditch to make it big.

And so we spit passive-aggressive lines of faint praise at each other across Vinh’s living room while our host rolled his eyes. I do not remember even the gist of them, only that the understated enmity kept flowing between us.

This kind of tension won’t hold between pure enemies.  Steve and I do care a great deal about each other.  He’d seen me messed up with drugs and alcohol when we were only teens and messed up on my own psychosis in the years between.  He’d helped me through both kinds of messes more times than we could remember.  He knew what I looked like on no sleep and knew what a bad sign that was with me.  There was no way he could miss the profound disturbance in me as I kept pacing on the back deck, chain-smoking Vinh’s cigarettes.

And I knew Steve was a worrier and someone who took things to heart.  I knew I was worrying him, and the me that was fully me was sorry I could not stop.

But by then, the Dark Lord had come back, and as things got snippier and snippier with my old friend, the Sumerian demon suggested, then implored, and then all but demanded I kill my quasi-rival.  Over and over, the voice came up acidic, and the only thing I could do for peace was head out to the deck and put a pane of glass between us. 

Steve stayed for burgers, and I bit my tongue and ate at the same time. As the day went on, he and Vinh cracked open a few beers. It was the first time since before I had been in the hospital that I was around alcohol, and the booze disturbed me more than usual. Often I got annoyed by drunk people, and once in a while, I felt tempted to drink, but whenever I felt both, I usually excused myself from the situation. Coupled with violently threatening psychosis, it was almost enough to make me pack it in for the hospital again.

Then Steve left, and a peace settled over me. I used one of the coping skills for dealing with voices that I had learned in the hospital – I put on some headphones and let the music drown out the noise in my head. When everything seemed almost calm, I helped myself to more Benadryl and managed to sleep until four AM.  

## Chapter 20

I awakened then and stomped around Vinh’s house, playing with his toys – Macs and game systems and more. Vinh was only able to sleep until perhaps five-thirty before he had to get ready for his rotation. He gave me a few curt words about taking care of myself and taking it easy over a cup of coffee and then went on to live his life.

Still disturbed from the drinking cravings of the night before, I decided to find a local AA meeting and then perhaps look for a job. A friend in the program had put the idea in my head that something like a gas station clerk would be perfect for me just then. 

I would be busy but not have to think too much and could take care of myself financially, at least to an extent. Vinh had offered to let me stay rent-free until I got my life together, but even in my mad mind, I knew that his good graces had an expiration date and that there was some urgency to my getting a real life. 

So, I drove the mile grid of Detroit – Twelve Mile, Fourteen Mile, Thirteen Mile, stopping at a few places. A couple of times, I was told not even to bother turning in an application, but I got three or four from other places and felt reasonably content with my efforts. 

Having gotten the last of these forms, I hopped into my car and headed forward fast, forward right over a ledge. There was a thunderous clunk, and I jumped out of the car and surveyed the damage. I had put the front wheels over a three- or four-foot straight drop of cement, but obviously, the chassis had bottomed out, and the back wheels could not follow. I had stopped halfway, and the car was teetering like a seesaw as I climbed out. 

I started laughing. I knew nothing else. There were three yuppie bikers near a phone booth, and I asked for suggestions. They could only shrug. I was left there for perhaps five minutes watching the car come to rest and then rock ever so slightly on that edge.

At last, a tow truck pulled up to a pump. I had not called the tow truck. It was there for gas. I approached the driver and begged for his help. He hopped into the cab, and as he did, I grabbed the edge of his door and spoke to him through the crack: “I have nothing. No cash. No credit. No debit. Can you still help?” 

He must have been able to tell from the desperation in my voice or maybe even from the smell of my fear that I told the truth and that I was in a world of shit. He nodded, and a few minutes later, I had my car again. 

There was never any damage found from the incident. I tooled off, feeling exhilarated by my near disaster and my escape from it.  I got so excited that I missed a turn, and then missed another turn, and soon had no idea how to even get to one of the mile streets. 

By then, it was Sunday morning, and I was careening through fancy neighborhoods and past elegant churches and the fancy parishioners entering or exiting them. I stopped at a Unitarian place, but I must have missed the service because there was no one to see who could give me directions back to the grid. So I grabbed a few pamphlets, prayed as they had taught me to do in AA, and when I got to the end of that windy suburban jag, there was one of the Mile Roads, there was the Detroit grid again.

Having been spurned by parking lots and abandoned by the people of God, or at least whatever Oversoul Unitarians go for these days, if any, it seemed wise to head home. When I got back to Vinh’s house after a few more detours past mansions and my car had been parked, I got out, locked it, and decided I was safe. I resolved not to go out again for AA meetings or anything else. 

This seemed wise and probably would have been. Then Ty called about the show and told me to go. Without a thought, I said yes and got the address. The lesson of the morning, terrifying but without consequence, was all for naught.  I was going out again. I was going to a part of Metro Detroit I had never seen. It was not a nice part of the area. The edge I had yet to fall from was far higher than three feet.

## Chapter 21

I drove out from Clawson toward downtown Pontiac. My destination was a difficult-to-find bar called the Crofoot, where the noise-pop band Buckshot was to play that night. I was to meet Ty and Devin and friends outside and get the ticket Ty was holding for me. 

Before I left Vinh’s place, I had printed out internet directions from one door to the other. I followed them and ended up at a Hilton on the outskirts of Pontiac. Confused, I left the car, went into the hotel, and asked if the Crofoot was near. The woman behind the desk looked at me as if I were asking for directions to the moon. 

I got nowhere and had nowhere to go, so I stopped in a liquor store where a kind Arab gave me a route to downtown, where I would have to ask for directions again.

I found the Crofoot by parking in the city center and following an out-of-place gang of hipsters to the door. Waiting in line, I called Devin to see if he and Ty were near. Devin told me to relax. 

I told him the devil was telling me to kill every hipster I saw. 

Devin told me to relax again. I lit a cigarette, and my friends were there by the time it was gone. Ty and Devin had a Japanese girl, a Colombian aristocrat, and three well-styled nerds with them. Ty made a comment knocking my attire, asking if I had come straight there from church. I was wearing a pink-pinstriped suit with a pink shirt and a red tie, and I thought I was it.

The Dark Lord really had it in for the cool kids that night. The longer I was around these young and dapper college kids, the more I felt the resistance in me wear down. It was only a matter of time before I gave in to the devil and took his orders. This was becoming clear. I could not continue to function on my minimal dose of medication, and I had no way to get more without going back into a hospital. 

Going to the hospital meant that the continuing order of treatment would kick in, and I would lose any say over my destiny until doctors gave my will back to me, though. Still, bondage was looking better and better. At least that would mean that no well-styled corpses would be left on the floor of the Crofoot. 

I went to the bar with the Columbian aristocrat, and he offered to buy me a drink. I asked for a glass of water with every kind of fruit that the bar had. He handed me my soaked salad, and I stirred it a bit and sipped as we discussed his master’s thesis, and I pretended to know enough about architecture to give him condescending advice. The politeness of his upbringing carried the day, and he treated me kindly so that I felt that he liked me when, in reality, his goodwill was likely pity for the sick.

Devin was becoming increasingly annoyed with my strange comments and arrogant posture. He and Ty both knew me well enough to know that I was on the verge of something terrible and seemed more than anything to be, hoping that I just did not break down in public. This had less to do with embarrassment for them than on embarrassment on their behalf. There also seemed to be an increasing awareness that I could be very dangerous. 

I felt dangerous. When I was not listening hard to the concert to drown out my auditory hallucinations, I was talking to people around me, loudly, to keep them at bay. This made me even more annoying to Devin, and he ended up leaving early. I gave him my keys so he could chill out in my car. 

There were only two songs left in the set that he would miss, and he had seen the band before. I did not know it at the time, but Devin had decided to go off his medication for bipolar disorder and ADHD without any medical supervision. His irritability was a symptom of that, but it did not help that I was being exceptionally loud, for no other apparent reason than arrogance.

After a few minutes of Devin being gone, I decided to leave the show early and find him. He and I somehow just missed each other, passing by on the two short blocks from my bar to the car. 

I could see the vehicle and was looking for Devin beside it when my eyes met those of a black man in a Michigan State football jersey and then those of the man in a tracksuit beside him. 

“What the fuck are you looking at?” the tracksuited man said, pronouncing every syllable. 

“I don’t have any money or credit cards,” I said.

“You better do something to stay safe. Let me see your phone,” the tracksuit said.

I handed the old cell over, and they pocketed it. But instead of running, the marauders had a point to make.

“You just fucked with Satan’s Army,” the man in the jersey said, identifying their gang.

“We are God!” the tracksuit screamed, and then the pair sprinted across the street and down an alley. I remembered Redd then. The Satanist who summoned the demon that may or may have been possessing me was from very near where I stood. He had mentioned the gang Satan’s Army when I asked him how he came to worship the Devil. Once, he had been in the same gang as the men who had just mugged me. I had been brought to the place where my inner death was born.

I was left there for no more than a minute when a bystander who had watched the whole thing from his parked car called me over. “I’m an off-duty policeman,” he said. “Those are evil guys. I know where they hide.” 

It was strange to hear a big city cop drop the word evil in conversation. What those men had done in the past was, I later learned, terrible. One was a murderer waiting to be caught for conviction. At the time, however, the whole scene felt confusing more than anything else.

Just then, Ty and Devin and their gang walked up and told me it was time to go.

“I need to stay here a while,” I said. “I’m in some trouble. Give me my keys, Devin.”

“You never gave them to me,” he said in a spacey way.

“Then I lost them,” I said.

“Jesus Christ, Mason,” Ty said. “I’ve got to go. I have an eight o'clock class tomorrow.”

“Ty, I just got mugged by a Satanist gang that trained Redd, and I can’t go anywhere until the police get here.”

“I’m really sick of your Bible stories, Mason,” Ty said. “You need to cut that out and head home with us.”

“Ty, this is real. My phone got stolen by two Black Satanists in athletic attire.”

“I don’t have time for this,” Ty said.

He and Devin walked off, leaving me there with no phone and no keys to my car. They had been gone only seconds when the squad cars arrived, and the chase was on.

Within five minutes, I was in a squad car heading to their spot. The offenders were in cuffs and baring teeth, but they could not see me in the squad car. I identified the assailants and then was taken to the police department to wait until I could find a ride out of there. 

They had to keep my phone for evidence, and I had gotten no number out of it but remembered Ty’s phone number off the top of my head. He answered, tired, and even more annoyed than when I had last spoken with him.

I told him that I was at the Pontiac police station with no way home and no phone. It was an hour before he made the drive back to Pontiac from Ann Arbor. In the meantime, I sat in the lobby until it bored me and then hung out with a homeless man across the street from the station. 

He wanted money or booze, and I had neither, but I told him I happened to know that God was very near him. By God, I meant me. By that point, whatever reality was left in me had been shattered. I was gone, believing I was God, fighting the devil’s murderous orders within, knowing that mine was the battle of righteousness that would save the world. 

Stress is like that. It activates symptoms, and the night had been not only stressful but surreal. Weeks later, when the depositions started to arrive in the mail asking me to testify against Satan’s Army, I had proof of the strangeness, but when Ty got there, it was all just a fantasy to him.

We fought the whole way back to Ann Arbor about whether or not what had happened had really happened. When we got into the center of that college town, stopped at a light, I thanked my younger brother sarcastically and jumped out of the running Jeep that had brought me that far. 

I walked then, opening my wallet and leaving a trail of credit cards and IDs along the way, honestly believing Ty would somehow be able to follow my marked path straight to the psychiatric ER at the University of Michigan hospital. I had wanted to go to the best hospital in the state from the start and was at least achieving one of my goals. The darkness had settled around me and was me, and it was to be some time before I would be free enough to hurt myself again.

That was the end of my few days out on my own. As I sat waiting to talk to a doctor, I knew that I would not be out of that kind of place for a very long time. 

When it, at last, was time to sit down with the attending physician, I was gone. I threatened to end the world through violence and predicted that I would destroy several high-ranking members of the Bush administration because of their sins. 

Some obscure footnote of the Patriot Act dictated that I had to be placed in restraints and kept in seclusion until the extent of my violent plans could be ascertained. I willingly wrapped myself in the straitjacket and would be there for the next ten or so hours. Every few hours, a nurse came in and shot me up with syringes of the antipsychotics that I had needed weeks ago.

Somehow it was decided that legally, I was bound to be treated in Roosevelt through their court system. So, restrained and strapped to a stretcher, I lay alone in the back of an ambulance that wheeled me across the state of Michigan for almost three hours, to its western edge where the land ended. 

The paramedics got their directions wrong and brought me into my therapist’s office, which was next door to the Behavioral Health Unit. I remember turning my head to say hi to the receptionist before the stretcher was wheeled back out, and I was taken the last short distance back to the hospital where I had just been only days before. 

When they loosened the straps and took off the jacket, I stood and got dizzy, having been down so long that I couldn’t keep my head straight. It would not be the last time I was strapped down and shot up in seclusion, but that first time I felt that I left a part of myself in the restraints and would never get it back.

## Chapter 22

I sat across from Joyce, the therapist, who had refused to acknowledge my condition because she earnestly believed that I was faking my symptoms for what behavioral psychologists call secondary gain. What this means is that, in her mind, I pretend to go crazy so that people are kind to me and take care of me and sometimes even buy me things. Thus, the behavior of losing one’s mind becomes reinforced; there is an incentive for it; there are multiple rewards. 

There was a cynical logic to her explanation of my problems. Perhaps if all I did was to freak out for a few days, maybe do another few in the hospital, and then go on with my life – perhaps then I could see why the incentive she described caused me to choose madness. But that incentive, being treated well and given generous attention, is pathetically small in light of the downsides from my breakdowns. 

Who would choose to be catatonic for months while the world passed by? Who would relish the social stigma of having a psychotic disorder and spending the rest of life labeled as crazy and, by assumption, dangerous? Who would choose to hear the devil howl for the blood of loved ones? 

Even assuming I was lying about the symptoms, which I was not, the life my supposed play for attention was to bring me – homelessness, penniless, often starving, always cold – could not possibly be worth any reward.

Still, I had left on reasonably good terms with her and Dr. Wynne, having calmed a bit when it became clear I would be set free. I had reason to believe she would be very sympathetic in light of the way I was brought in – strapped down for hours in an ambulance. This hope for kindness, I knew to be dashed as soon as I walked into her room. 

Her face was stiffened into an unprofessional scowl as if I were some homeless man harassing her. I sensed that my return was an imposition of sorts. Because my father sat on the board for the hospital that oversaw the Unit, and because his best friend was the CEO, and because his second-best friend handled rights violations in the Unit, she knew I had my finger on a button I could push to throw everything off, perhaps even cost her her job. 

And here I was again, evidence that their treatment approach had failed, drawing more attention to her because of who I was, knowing that my treatment would be high-profile if only due to nepotism. I wondered if she was still clinging to her false theory.  

“Well, Mr. Dennis, what can we do for you this time?”

“I want to go to the Mayo Clinic,” I said.

She paused, looking me over for a few seconds, and then tightened all the fullness of her lips into a flat line. “Now, this is exactly what I’m talking about, Mason. Secondary gain.”

“How?” I asked, tightening up myself.

“You come back in, and you want a reward for falling apart.”

“Where the hell did you get your degree?”

“No, you don’t need the Mayo Clinic, Mason. You need our intensive outreach program, you need to be in an adult foster home, you need to get disability, you need to do what everyone else who has what you claim to have does.”

“You’re out of your goddamn mind, Nurse Ratchet.”

“Who’s that?”

“Are you a joke?”

“We don’t have a Nurse Ratchet on staff?”

“My God. You’ve never seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.”

“What does that have to do with anything?”

“I want another therapist.”

“You can’t have one. I am the director here, as well. I decide who goes where. You’re staying with me.”

“That’s against the fucking law,” I said.

“Arguable.”

“I’m done here,” I said and stood to leave. Before I slammed the door behind me, though, I said, “This is war.”

In retrospect, I admire Joyce’s boldness in the face of the power I had. She was sticking to her clinical hunch despite the potential consequences of doing so. Her cavalier violation of my right to choose a therapist showed a near brash sense of self-righteousness; she would use suspect means to gain her desired ends. I am sure such methods flew unchecked with just about everyone in the place except for a few. I was one of those few, and I was organized and ready to make her life very, very difficult.

Since I had been admitted, I had kept every piece of paperwork I had been given, from asinine self-esteem worksheets to inventories of possessions and everything in between. This was not enough, however. I needed to see my chart to get the work done I wanted to get done. 

I walked up to the nurse’s station and demanded to see it. They refused and refused every request, even as I cited the freedom of information act as well as the Michigan code dictating rights of mental patients, but I was still denied. Again, I said, “This is war.”

Since I had left, the roster of patients had changed a little. Carrie had been gone since before I got out. My singing disciple had taken his song elsewhere and might spend the rest of his life looking for me to follow again. 

One kid had been there since I was first admitted three weeks before. Isiah fancied himself a great rapper, and he had a commanding voice, the kind that gets hits, and his rhymes were decent, if derivative, but he could not beat me in freestyle battles. 

When I am up, I can rhyme quickly and indefinitely, and it is only a matter of kicking up my mean streak, and I am in top form. Rhyming is a symptom of some disorders; when it cannot be controlled, it is termed clanging. Isiah was clanging. He spoke only in booming flow, and it was clear he was stranded in a world where his delusions of grandeur were real. I could relate to him completely. 

We struck up a friendship, talking about music and madness, the two topics we both knew well. I got to like Isiah, even though he was a creepy jerk with the female patients.  It was pleasant to have someone my age to chat with.

In addition to Isiah, there was a very sickly, very angry redhead who was missing chunks of teeth and could easily be mistaken for a very young man, though she was very much into discussing her female sexuality. Jennifer was thirty but looked something like the fat kid on the little league team who is just then being picked last. She liked me a lot, followed me around, and made suggestive comments but was polite enough to keep her distance and still happy when I told her she could be my sister but not my lover. 

Jennifer was slow, had a kidney condition that kept her looking very juvenile, and type-1 diabetes, and congestive heart failure, and emphysema, and schizoaffective disorder, which amounts to having both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder at once. I will likely never meet anyone again who had as many bad breaks as her when it came to genetics.

I confided in both Jennifer and Isiah that I was God the father come to Earth to save humankind from itself. While neither started dressing in bedsheets and singing spontaneous hymns, they both acknowledged the possibility that I might be telling the truth. 

Almost everyone did, including several members of the staff. They did not go so far as to say that they believed I was a great religious figure, but I was almost always met with an “anything’s possible” attitude and usually two statements: that if God were anyone, he would be someone like me and that the world could sure as hell use a savior whether or not that savior was really divine. More than once, I was told that if I knew my destiny was to unite the world in peace and love, that I had a lot of work to do to get myself into the mental shape to pull something like that off.

Joyce had her alliance as well. This included every social worker in the place and Dr. Wynne. Together they kept me off of more than a meaningless dose of Seroquel (200 milligrams; I would not get better until I was on 1200), and this kept me mad and getting madder. They were worsening the problem through a ridiculous plan based on a juvenile understanding of their field. 

I have since heard dozens of stories of former patients who were treated just as poorly or worse than I was at the Unit. What was happening to me, the insistence that I needed my medication cut and attempts to call a bluff that was not a bluff, was almost standard procedure there. I have been told by people who have been in the state hospital for the criminally insane that it is far more pleasant and therapeutic to be than where I was. 

The reason that I had attempted to enter a different, more esteemed hospital was bare and transparent. Joyce had never seen the cuckoo’s nest, but she was about to find herself crashed in it with no recourse to deal with resistance. The Mayo Clinic was a joke, and I felt laughed at. I simmered toward a boiling plan that would drive the staff to the edge of their patience and even into violence. This meant war.

## Chapter 23

There was comedy to the sock rebellion. When I tell this story to friends, they always laugh. But, like many funny stories, this one was, at least by some, taken very seriously. The faintest whisper of insurrection among the patients seemed to cause intensely contrasting reactions from the staff. 

When it came down to it, there were only two of us who wore the socks, though, over cigarettes, every patient professed support for what we did. There was no particular event that set off my resistance. There was only a general rage that I was not being treated for mental illness. 

The irony of a patient inciting discord because that patient feels under-medicated, such a  ridiculous situation, did not escape me. I only wanted to be treated like a crazy person and not a faker, so I made up my mind to show how out of my mind I was.

That was the mindset gripping me as I reached down one morning after my meditation and devotional and found a long, striped tube sock.  I believe it was of a brand meant for women, but the idea that tube socks could be gender-specific was anathema to me, so I wore it regularly. This morning, however, I wore it differently than usual.  The two stripes were black, but when I tied it around my right bicep, most of that black was hidden. 

I walked out of my room to the smoking one, getting a few sidelong glances from the workers behind the nurses’ station, but little more than that. I sat down in a plastic, round chair and lit a cigarette for the supposedly low-IQ redhead. For someone considered challenged, she was very perceptive. I supposed that many suppositions about her were wrong. Jennifer noticed the band on my arm and asked if I was starting a war.

“Of sorts,” I said.

A grungy looking Jesus-freak in the corner said, “It’s about goddamn time.”

I stared straight into him then and wondered if he knew I was the God he was invoking. Behind the sock, the rebellion was my idea, and it was only the first phase, I thought, in a peaceful revolution that would conquer the world. Still, despite the dozen or so socks I had ready in my room, I only managed to get Jennifer in on it, and if she were all I could convert to my way, the future of my cult was not looking promising.

“Why a sock?” the grungy one asked.

“It fits,” I said, leaving the statement ambiguous.

“Give me a sock. I’m in,” Jennifer said. I had stuffed my pocket with a few of them in the event that I would be joined in my movement, and Jennifer got the other half of the black and white pair.

“You all are crazy,” said a young woman with thick limbs and a thin torso. She had taken up with an ex-con who had chronic pain, and the two were popping painkillers and tranquilizers as if we were at a party and not in a ward. This lighthearted duo seemed reasonably happy with the hospital just the way it was. 

After all, it was supplying them with massive quantities of anything they needed, no matter how addictive. The result was patients nodding off like junkies in our groups because their therapists and psychiatrists were still pumping them full of what got them in trouble in the first place. It was Club Med, and after pill time, there was relaxation and conversation and a sense of joy and camaraderie. Though the Unit was bent on reducing my prescriptions, their treatment of actual addicts seemed to favor abusing any drug that kept them happy.  I’ve never seen that fix anyone’s real problems. It didn’t bother me that the two pill-heads refused to join my movement; they were lost already.

Everyone else was very supportive. Joyce and Dr. Wynne had made just about everyone in there far, far worse than when they came in. It seemed that as many people were shipped off to the state hospital in Kalamazoo or the adult foster shelter downtown as were released to the world right away. 

By the time the sock was around my arm, I had been in the hospital for nearly a month minus three days, and the weeks had become unbearable. Every day, I thought I would be released. I would call Devin and tell him I would soon be free, call my parents, and inflate the grades of my recovery, call my sponsor and tell him everything I was learning. None of these moves did any good. I stayed where I was and would remain where I was until my hearing.

That arm wrestle with a giant defined my stay – knowing that the pressure was going to hurt far worse when it was over, and I had to live with the painful consequences of arrogant conflict. I had to go to court and was to be ordered to a year of complete adherence to my treatment plan. 

It sounded like blind devotion in a profession I had come to have a tragic laugh about every day – the kind of laughter that had replaced my tears since I had been medicated. To get out of the hurt, I needed to build a case that I was not a danger to myself or others, and do that I needed a good lawyer, but to get one of those, I would have needed money I did not have, and so I went with the public defender, a slob who showed up fifteen minutes late to the hearing and never said a word to me about my case. 

I am pretty sure that kind of hearing would not have stood up under any scrutiny whatsoever, but no one would represent me for free, at least they would not until I finished building my malpractice case against Dr. Wynne, Joyce, and the rest of behavioral health unit which had all but destroyed me. 

Every day I got madder and angrier. I put on the sock to keep from boiling over and throwing a chair at my seventy-year-old shrink to break his hip. From the way he bowed to Joyce, I already knew he had no spine to break.

The cowardice and fright of the staff in the face of two patients walking around with armbands and raving about rights violations and lawsuits were pathetic. We were harmless. I just had finally come to a point where I wanted to draw as much attention to myself as I could if only so that I would finally get treated instead driven further into the house of mirrors. My reflections grew more distorted with every step. 

When the head nurse and a few mental health workers expressed unflinching support for our cause, I was diseased enough to believe that they did so out of faith in the supposedly evident fact of my godhood. Nevertheless, getting some of the staff on our side proved amazingly upsetting to those higher-ups who were not taking to our gesture of solidarity in protest. In the minds of those above the nurse, the socks had to go.

There was a worker named Henry at whom I would shout lines from Shakespeare about a king who had the same first name that he did. Henry liked to play with and tease the patients, good-naturedly but unprofessionally. Giving someone the wrong dinner tray and then switching it back as if that were a brilliant joke was one thing, but the way bullied half-wits with a whole wit and left them baffled and upset was another thing altogether. 

I may not be the wittiest guy, but I have a fast mouth, especially when I am unstable and can say many, many cruel lines very, very quickly. As a result, when Henry went after me a few times, I ran circles around him and had the room laughing at his folly by the end of it. From that moment on, Henry seemed to like me less but also treat me with loving-kindness, perhaps only because he knew what I needed.

Once the sock rebellion spread to Jennifer, he was upset, but it was the overheard murmurs of support that seemed to bother him even more. Years later, when I met him again on a return visit, he told me he thought it only a matter of time before I had looped socks around every arm in the place. “You turned this place into Waco,” he was to say.  

If that were the case, Henry was the federal crew who all but burned the place down. The staff found a clause that they interpreted to mean that I could not express gang activity through showings of color or personal decoration. 

Just after that, Henry descended on Jennifer and ripped the sock off of her pudgy, childlike arm, knocking her over in the process and loosening her throat until it screamed into the glass and seemed as if it would shatter it all. Jennifer started pushing and shouting, “You mother sockers! Sock you and sock off! Go sock yourself, Henry. I don’t give a sock.”

This last line came as Henry held her in something near a professional wrestler’s hold, and she was shot up with something sedating and dragged off to the quiet room, the padded one, all white, like the movies, like the horror shows. From there, I heard the shouts of, “Sock you! Sock every mother socking one of you sockers! We are going to win!”

When the staff approached me about removing the sock, I cited a part of the mental health code that meant I could wear my own clothing without interference and was left to wear my own sock alone, walking proud as a crusader. 

I kept up the threats of legal action as it became increasingly clear that I would never get proper representation. The hospital even went so far as to bar my personal psychologist of fifteen years from giving a formal second opinion to the judge. I was told that he had not filled out the proper paperwork to get clearance to be on the ward. I was violated again. 

All the while, Joyce kept me as a patient, and every day I asked to see anyone but her. With the sock around my arm, though, I had become dangerous somehow. I was kept under twenty-four-hour surveillance.

At last, I relented. I knew that fighting the process that was maddening me and that had already destroyed my life would only keep me in Chinese handcuffs, more stuck the more I tried to pull out. So, I decided to go with the flow, all while gathering more and more evidence for the crimes I felt were underway. 

I wanted my resistance to go underground. I would give a showing of surrender and not let anyone know how conditional it was. So, I walked up to the nurses’ station, untied the sock, waved it like a white flag, and set it down. “I surrender,” I said, putting on my best face of false contrition. 

As I turned, I smiled wildly and then saw Henry with a bemused smirk on his face. I could not take that. So, I stepped his way as whispered in his ear: “There will always be a sock tied around my heart.” 

## Chapter 24

I sat across from my sponsor Lee. He gave great directions when asked, or at least had until the Ativan tangle. I was telling him angrily that they kept trying to put me on a tranquilizer, that I had a history of abusing that particular tranquilizer, and that I would not follow the doctors to take a very high dose of it. 

Lee reminded me of the old AA medication party line – that playing doctor is as dangerous as relapsing and often one and the same. It is so dangerous, at least with mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, because going off of them was a high for some and destabilizing for all. 

The problem with Lee’s logic was that he was equating a drug with abuse potential that I had taken full advantage of many, many times with pills that were not considered narcotics – drugs that made one feel saner rather than buzzed or even mellow. 

I told him that I would not follow the doctor’s orders just because they were doctor’s orders when the doctor was ordering me now to relapse on my drug of choice. Honestly, I prefer tranquilizers rather than alcohol in most circumstances. They are easier to hide in every way, and they are quicker even than liquor in their stupefying payoff. 

What Dr. Wynne wanted me to do so that I could relax was tantamount to giving a heroin addict heroin as a cure for anything other than heroin withdrawals. The junkie gets his wisdom teeth out, and the dentist prescribes not Vicodin; he goes straight for China White. 

Lastly, I reminded my sponsor that my doctor had already kept me on a dangerously low dose of my most crucial mood stabilizer, and I was now being asked to trust an even worse suggestion.

“You are not a doctor. You are not a doctor. You are not a doctor.” 

I felt as though he were repeating himself with the faith of Dorothy clicking her heels in Oz, blind and childish.  I wasn’t wearing magic shoes, and saying something trite three times was not going to make it so. But then he turned the corner on his direction, and I saw where he was taking me.

“Maybe you haven’t gotten better yet because you haven’t taken Ativan as he wanted you to.”

That was enough for me to cave. It did not take a terrible amount of persuasion anyhow; I was being told by my mentor in recovery to relapse, and the only real problem I had with it was that I knew I was doing the wrong thing and furthermore that I would get away with it. 

The prescription was being held for me as needed at the nurses’ station, and all I had to do to lose all touch with reality was to ask someone who was not supposed to do harm to let me harm myself. Had I been cutting my wrists, I would have been in deep shit. But I was doing nothing of the kind; instead, I was inflicting brain damage with an incredibly addictive narcotic in a place where my brain was supposed to heal. The irony had me in chains.

The hallucinations did not begin after the first dose. But I blacked out immediately after swallowing one, got into the public bathroom, plugged up the shower drain, and caused a flood. I was shown eerie footage of myself doing as much. I could not deny it just because I had no thought of it ever happening. There was the first proof of my problem.

Once the addiction set in, though, I did not want to go through the withdrawals that I had once dealt with years and years before during my pill head phase. So, I took full responsibility for the vandalism and was told that even the slightest outburst in the coming days would end me up in the dreaded quiet room – white, padded. 

Meanwhile, I got another hit, and this one really took me off. I went into my room, and when the lights were off, I saw thick swaths of cobwebs all around me, as if I were in the liar of a giant but absent spider. I collected these cobwebs, pulling them off the walls and clearing my room out, but when I would turn around and look away from a place I had just removed, the webs would grow right back. 

My first solution was to close my eyes and try to sleep it away. When I did this, however, I saw slithering, writhing scales instead of peaceful black, as if my eyes had just become a magnifying glass held over a live snake or a flopping fish. So I opened my eyes, and the cobwebs had grown as thick as they could grow so that to get out of the room, I had to claw my way through their resistance – I could feel them stick to my skin and gather around me with their spooky tensile strength, pulling hard before breaking. 

I stopped in the door short of running out because a thought had come to me. I flicked the light switch and blinked for a few seconds. Everything was gone again except for reality. Then I flicked the switch back down, and everything came back thick or slimy as ever.

I sprinted out of my room and to the Nurse’s station. Henry, still smug about the failure of the sock rebellion, stood there and shouted, “How all occasions do inform me and spur my dull revenge.” I asked him to please come with me and told him that I needed his help. Henry followed me to my room, and I opened the door and brought him into the dream. I flicked the switch, and there were the webs. I closed my eyes, and there were the scales. 

“You don’t see them, do you?”

“What is this game, Mason?”

“Do you see the cobwebs I am pulling down? They are in my hand. Look.”

Henry said there was nothing and flipped up the switch. Once again, the light took my madness with it, at least for a moment. My hand looked empty now, even felt as though the weight of the tangle was gone.

The next day I stopped taking Ativan and was suffering through the withdrawal anxiety when my father called me. 

“You sound edgy,” my father said after only hearing me greet him. I was. He knew me from the years of functioning as my de facto shrink.

“I’m not fucking edgy, dad. I’m getting cut on the fucking edge, here, Dad. I’m fucked up. I’m fucked, dad. Fucked.”

“I don’t appreciate that kind of language, Mason,” my dad said.

“Did it ever occur to you that you’re not talking to Mason?”

I said in a hissing sort of alien reptile voice, something evil croaking through me that sounded like nothing from this world.

“Can I have Mason back?”

“He’s fucked!” I screamed, holding out the last word for several seconds and really wailingDr. Wynne and me in so doing.

“Mason,” said a wide, cruel nurse, at least two hundred fifty pounds and short as a pony, raised her voice now. “You say that word one more time, and I’m calling security.”

“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!” I said it knowing it would take me away to another world. As she picked up the phone and called up the white shirts, the lizard came back and snarled. “I fucked your son, bitch!”

“Knock it off,” she bellowed as if throwing all her many pounds into the force of her voice.

“I fucked the son of God,” I said, still with the demon inflection.

The security guards already had their flashlights drawn. Two nights before, they had beaten Jennifer into her bed after she said she would kill someone if they did not give her an apple juice. 

Jennifer, of course, was diabetic, and her sugar would not hold up to that, and so she was denied over and over again. Then the tantrum and the thrown phone caused the staff to call people to beat the shit out of a plump, girlish little woman when she would not go to where I was headed.

I wanted nothing of her kind of treatment. When the security guards arrived, I helped them put on the restraints after the shot of antipsychotics. They had tried to give me another injection of Ativan, but I would not take it. The two security guards shared a look as I refused the injection, ready to pin me down and shoot me up with a drug that would make me far sicker.

As I was about to be shot up with poison, Sandra, the charge nurse who had always been on my side, got back from her break. She looked at the large nurse who had called the security and said, “What the hell are you doing to my patient?”

The large nurse began to squawk something forgettable, fumbling with her excuse.

Sandra dressed the other nurse down with a few heated, quiet words. Then Sandra approached me and said, “What’s wrong, baby?”

I had learned that lesson and had learned from Jennifer’s sacrifice that I should not show the slightest resistance. Not at first, anyway – though as soon as I was strapped into the restraining jacket and then strapped in full to a stretcher, and nothing more could be feared from me as far as violence, I exploded. The devil I let out. He had become my guard dog, three heads and all. I never saw Sandra look sadder than as I bellowed.

The reptile roared, a shrill bellow I have only heard in horror movies. I could not stop my mouth from doing it. The yell just kept shaking through me.  Security was still there, one fellow at the door, and I managed to move my eyes in his direction. 

I have never seen someone more frightened. Then I began to scream in my voice, pained, breaking through, “Does this sound like I’m faking it? Does this sound like borderline personality disorder, you bitches? Does this sound borderline to you? Does it? Does it? Does it?”

The Abilify broke it all down then. The Dark Lord’s grip on the puppet strings on my tongue slackened. I said nothing. What could I say? I looked over at the guard and began to cry. This swing only made him look more frightened.

I stayed in that room all night and was set up with a worker to watch me all day and night. The weekend hit, my fifth one there, and the weekend doctor came on, and when she did, she increased my medication three-fold at my behest. When Monday came, the hearing was a day away. 

Dr. Wynne knocked my medication back down to nearly nothing, but I had gathered enough strength from the days when I was not suffering from malpractice to stay calm and seem safe. Perhaps I was safe. 

The worst in me seemed to have passed that day; I only heard the Dark Lord in whispers from behind corners I was not willing to round. What a fool. I thought he was gone for good.

## Chapter 25

I awoke the morning of the hearing and went to the bathroom I had shared with my neighbor. When I looked through the door, there was a beautiful brunette staring back at me from an oversized chair. I blushed and slammed the door. I had been in only my underwear. 

A thrill went through me. The woman was in scrubs. I had not seen her the whole month I had been in there, so I guessed rightly that she was some kind of floater. She had these huge eyes that made her look like a cartoon character, but a lovely one. 

I decided to try and impress her. So, I walked out to the hall with a blank sheet of computer paper resting on the back of a legal pad and stood in front of her. In a few seconds, I did a likeness of her with quick flashes of a pen. Then I showed it to her, and she was floored. 

When she asked if she could keep it, I told her that I would gladly let her have it, but not until I had colored it. There was a full set of washable markers there. Most of the patients spent most of their free time coloring like children who favored precision over creativity. 

It was coloring or puzzles – mindless occupiers of minds that seemed to favor the comfort of such time-wasting. I looked down at them, if unfairly. Most of the patients lacked a creative outlet, or, if they had one, were no good at it. My talent has always given me too many ways to waste my time. I colored the picture for the nurse and then decided to write her a song to boot.

There was a whiny old piano in the Behavioral Health Unit, and I used to play it for hours, another way I stayed away from the coloring and crafts that infantilized so many of the other patients. I went in to bang on those keys for the second time that day; I would play it at least three times every day and was getting a little better because of it. 

The piano has always been the musical instrument that I have been the best with. The song only took a few minutes to write – I work fast, especially when mixed as I was – and I played for her, again impressing her. She told me she was working a triple shift, twenty-four hours straight, and would have plenty of time to counsel me in the coming hours. I winked and walked off to be committed by a court.

That was the day that I really felt for the first time that surrendering to the mental health system of Agawatta County, however flawed it was, was the only option I had. If I did not, the odds were stacked so high against me that when they fell the wrong way, I would be crushed by them. There was no point in resistance, but agreeing to adherence at least would stem the red tide of resentments that were drowning me in bad blood. 

Vengeance and the quest for it do not offer the peace of forgiveness. I still wanted to do something about the way I was treated. I was stuffing the rights violation box with form after form detailing what I felt was my mistreatment. But when it came to taking on the court system with no lawyer and a therapist who had not been allowed to see me, I knew it was a lost cause and could not keep wasting my energy fighting it. I needed that energy to heal.

The hearing was a sick joke. My public defender showed up ten minutes late and was only able to consult with me for about a minute - after the hearing. His briefcase was a mess, and his tie and shirt and slacks all clashed in different ways. I immediately resented him and listened to nothing he said. He had sealed my fate only by neglecting my welfare. 

That was becoming the theme of my recent weeks, one that made me more frustrated and less healthy by the day. Going into a hospital with a rage problem and then being treated confrontationally felt as though it made as much sense as the doctor’s insistence on negligible amounts of medication. If I needed so few drugs, why did I need to be committed? 

They had a particular room for these hearings. They must have been quite common. There a magistrate stared me down from a teleconferencing TV. I had thought up so many reasons that I should not be court-ordered to comply with treatment that they overwhelmed me at that moment. 

Not only that, I had a pile of paperwork that I felt showed I had been the victim of malpractice. Yet here I was, defenseless before the arbiter of my fate. Joyce sat on one side of me and Dr. Wynne on the other. I felt as though they were soldiers holding my arms as an inquisitor decided how to torture me. And yet, there was in me an intuition that it would be a stronger move to comply, even if it seemed to be the easy way out.

So, despite all the rage from my mistreatment, I surrendered. I agreed to follow whatever I had to for the next year. It felt like complete defeat.  But at least after this defeat, I could retreat to the new nurse.

There is a place in the heart that opens before beauty but stays closed before anything else. This was the spillway gate that finally let me open up about one of the key tributaries of the river that had swept me into madness. 

Just before I had broken down, I had tried and failed to contact a woman in New York named Terri.  I was obsessed with her. I had literally written my graduate school thesis about her. The obsession, at one point, had been mutual; she would tell me about her constant investigation into my life on social networking sites. At least she did when we were still talking before my mind collapsed entirely, and I blamed it all on her. 

When I say I wrote my thesis “about her,” it may bring to mind the meticulous research of a student of medieval history, or the rigorous proofs of a mathematician. Remember, my degree was Creative Writing.  My work was no less careful, no less crafted, but still, it was, after all, a fiction.  She was my inspiration for self-indulgence.  I took creative liberties with her.  But the truth of the story was its expression of what I had sincerely wanted from her and the disappointments I had truly felt. I carried a genuine sense that the world had wronged me by keeping Terri’s love from me while I was near enough to her to enjoy it. The unrequited or semi-requited love in the novel gave it a mood of bittersweet but commonplace taste, like cheap name-brand Dark Chocolate. It was trite. It was clichéd. It was nothing new under the sun.

I had not admitted my irrational blame of Terri for my breakdown to anyone until I discussed it with the new nurse, Laurel. Her task that day, the one that she would do for twenty-four hours, was to observe my neighbor, a patient who was considered a grave danger to himself. 

The patient was so heavily drugged, though, that she really had nothing to do more than sit in a big chair and watch the man sleep. So I stood in the doorframe of the bathroom that I shared with the dangerous man, and for hours after I took my night medication, she and I talked about why I felt that it was love that had made me mad.

“You can’t give someone that kind of power, or you’ll never heal.”

I thought about this and, for the first time, it applied not just to Terri but to all the people in my life. I had given my father that power, and Dr. Wynne, and Joyce, and Terri, and God knows how many women before her, and I had been sick most of my life because of that. It became apparent then that my inability to divorce people from the way I blamed them for influencing me was perhaps the problem. 

I don’t feel that I would have gone along with such reasoning if it had come from Joyce, however. How that all connected to the manifestation of evil within me I could not yet parse, though. They seemed to be to entirely different problems, but knowing there was more than one, I began an internal struggle of insight.

Laurel and I talked less formally after that impromptu therapy session. We knew a lot of the same people but had never met despite our overlapping social circles. I thought then that perhaps we had been at different ends of the same bar, our mutual friends floating between us, neither of us knowing we were connected at all, let alone how.  

I found out that she was applying graduate schools for a Ph.D. program in clinical psychology, that she owned her own home, that she was only a few months younger than me though she looked much younger than that, and other details of her life I was surprised that she would offer up to someone who had my reputation for being disturbed.

Around one or two in the morning, after she and I had talked for several hours, a nurse showed up and told me I was not allowed to speak to her the way I had been. He shut the bathroom door, but before going to bed, I slipped a bit of contact information under the door, doubting that she would ever use it but knowing that there had been enough of a connection for that to be possible.

The day after the hearing, I was taken into a conference room by Joyce, where she told me that I would be best off living in an adult foster home. I was not excited about the prospect of having to live with people who were like me or even worse than I was. Such a place was a small-scale nursing home. It sounded like the end of my life at twenty-seven, only I would not be so lucky as to die; I would live every day with the darkness of worsening lunatics around me, their hands pulling mine down into the hell of life as a ward of the state.

So how did I react to the suggestion that I needed that kind of care? I laughed. I laughed obnoxiously, snorting, and shaking my head to make clear my derision. I stood to walk out on the session but turned before I did to fire a parting shot. I did not know it, but that was to be my last session with Joyce. I looked at her wall, then looked at her intently and asked a nasty question.

“Were you too stupid to get a Ph.D. or just too lazy?”

I waited a few seconds for an answer, but she only pointed to the door. I left a slammed it behind me, smiling more widely than I had in weeks.

## Chapter 26

When I finally left the Behavioral Health Unit, I still believed I was God, I still believed I had a mission to conquer the Earth, I still heard the Sumerian demon frequently, I still heard him tell me to kill my parents and a long grudge list of others, and I had taken on newfound anger and disturbance from my negligent care in there. If anything, I had gotten worse since the first day I went in. 

After all, I had not had a significant med adjustment, and I had been in multiple stressful environments: being sedated, being mugged, and being strapped to a gurney for a hundred and seventy-eight-mile drive. The result was that the anger problem that had brought me into the Behavioral Health Unit was far, far worse.

The only change other than for me to get sicker was that my caregivers had secured a court order demanding compliance to treatment. All I could think was that if I had been treated at all, I would have had treatment to comply with. There had been no plan I could participate in, and yet I was being punished for non-participation regardless.

Joyce told me I had to learn that there were consequences to the words I was using. On that, and perhaps only that, she was in the right. In every other way, she deserved to be fired as she was a few months later. I would like to think that my appeals to family and friends high up in her organization played a role in that, but I think it is more likely that her romance with Dr. Wynne made her seem as unprofessional to sane people as we mad people already knew she was.

I got to see how little Joyce and Dr. Wynne cared about me the day after the court order sealed my fate for the year to follow. Sick as I was, I was invited into a final meeting with the couple. Their manner was smug and condescending, or at least it felt that way to me. 

They had defeated me. I could resist all I wanted to, but I would still be required to comply, or I would be treated against my will. A future of monthly shots to keep me down no matter what, of years in a foster home becoming dull and dim just to fit in, and of being bound to Roosevelt oppressed me. There was no chance for me to undermine the wrongheaded law the way I had undermined my wrongheaded medical care. I could tie socks around every one of my limbs, and I would still be beaten.

There, vanquished, I was asked the question I had been asked when admitted. “Do you want to kill anyone else or yourself?”

I gave the same answer I had carried since admission, one that no one seemed willing to hear until I had been damned to the underworld indefinitely. “No, I don’t want to kill anyone.” 

She did not ask if I still heard voices telling me to kill anybody. Instead, she sought to know whether the will to do so was there. It had never been. 

I came into the Behavioral Health Unit to rid myself of troubling hallucinations that were commanding me but whose demands I was fully capable of refusing. I told everyone I was safe, just in need of help, but some of the staff seemed to have more trouble than I did telling the difference between my hallucinations and reality. 

Sitting across from the two who seemed to have the hardest time doing this, I remembered my first session with Joyce, when she told me that if I knew I was hallucinating that I was not hallucinating. What shit.

“What about the hallucinations?” I asked.

“You don’t have hallucinations,” Dr. Wynne said. “You have what Freud called illusions.”

“What is that supposed to mean?”

“Illusions are quite similar to hallucinations, the difference being that they are based in reality. Voices that are based on real people instead of nonsense.” 

“That doesn’t matter,” I said. “If anything, it’s worse. Reality is more convincing than some imaginary friend that somehow survived childhood.”

“Dangerous, yes, they are. You have used your illusions to manipulate my other patients and even my staff. But regardless, if you are no longer a danger to them or anyone else, we have to release you. There’s someone who needs your bed more than you do.”

I knew then that I had only been kept in the hothouse for the weeds because I needed to be put under the control of the state, not because I needed to be healed.

I had been told that the order of treatment meant that I would not be able to live with any member of my family. Several friends who had been proposed as having places to crash were deemed unfit to care for me and dismissed. 

So, I had nowhere to go, and I knew what that meant. The treatment couple had found a foster home to put me in, and I would soon be living with the zombies. Some of these zombies would be as dangerous as any monster. The future dimmed in a flash, like the lights in prison as someone was electrocuted. Its light came back, but I knew something terrible and irreversible had already been done.

“So, where am I going?” I asked.

“Spinks,” Joyce said.

I sank through the chair. I had been to Spinks before. It was a terrible place. The last time I had been there, a woman had walked around screaming “Chicago Bears Chicago Bulls Chicago Fucking Cubs,” those words in an endless and thundering loop. 

The food in Spinks was terrible, literally being the food that was served in the county jail across the street. Worst of all, the security there was negligible. As bad as my caregivers had been in the hospital, I at least felt safe in the Behavioral Health  Unit. During my previous stay at Spinks, I had felt vulnerable and untreated. 

There were only two therapy groups a day, sometimes as few as one. Being sent there felt like a step down even from the hellish condemnation of life in a hospital without care to speak of.

“When do I leave?” I asked them.

“As soon as you find a ride over there.”

I walked out but stopped in the door and spat my last words at them. “I will pray for you both.” I have yet to see Joyce again. Her smirk seen over my shoulder said enough that she did not need to respond. Even God does not love people like them, I thought. If there is justice for me in any life, I thought, they will never be saved.

My mother had the day off and came to get me only a few hours after that last conference. In the meantime, I kept at my nurse to do my discharge paperwork frequently, so frequently that she seemed to be annoyed even as she tried to mask that emotion. 

Frustrated as I was, I decided to leave, having taken a parting shot. There were markers on my desk that I had been using to color in my drawings. I decided that more drawings were in order, drawings that were to outlast my stay. 

So, standing first on my bed and later on chairs, I covered walls from top to bottom with sketches of no particular consequence. The walls were fibrous, and the marker seeped into them, and there seemed to be no chance for them to be wiped or even washed away. My doodles were intentionally and goofily primitive. I felt that the place did not deserve quality art.  Still, I left them with graffiti signed by an oversized scrawl of my full name. 

When my nurse that day arrived to finish my discharge papers, she looked as though she were about to scream, but no sound came out of her. Only a shout: “This is reckless destruction of property.”

Sandra, the charge nurse, who had looked out for me my whole stay, must have overheard the raised voice because she was in the room within seconds. “Those are really beautiful,” she said. “What a sweet gift to leave behind.”

I never got a bill from that hospital, let alone a criminal charge. Had I been someone else, I likely would have gotten both.  My father and family friends were too entrenched in the administration of that place for me to get into trouble for anything except outright violence. 

That was the day that I realized why I had been allowed to revolt and disrupt groups and plug drains to flood the place, and no one had asked me or ordered me to be locked up in Kalamazoo State Hospital. The family who had felt so threatened by my problems must have been working and working and working to keep me from any harsh measures to correct those problems.

Perhaps that is why I was allowed to leave when I still thought that I was Christ’s father in a charged battle with the devil with the fate of the universe at stake. My mind had only darkened, and the shadows within it were still spreading. 

On the way to Spinks, I saw the leaves a duller color and thinning before my eyes. The sun was already relatively low at just after four PM. The world before my course as a space cadet was cast into a silhouette, but its sun was rising over to illuminate a place that looked less and less hospitable the more that I saw of it. 

As I stepped from the car, I felt heavier than I had before the drive to Spinks, my new planet more massive and making everything else weightier. I have yet to know a stronger gravity than being God come back to set the world right. But our bodies all fall at the same rate, and I am no lawbreaking feather.

# Part 2

## Chapter 1

Spinks is hard to describe quickly, other than to liken it to purgatory. My new residence wasn’t a waiting room. It was a waiting home. Much like the hospital, I was waiting for absurd, frustrating reasons.

Spinks lacked the security, staff, and resources to function as any kind of health care facility, though it did serve psychiatric and controlled medications to suicidal clients straight out of the emergency room. The staff required little if any training, with a few exceptions that were impressive. I later learned their pay was terrible. Nevertheless, there was no one working there for the wrong reasons. The staff was kind to the last. That was what I needed as I bided my time.

People were there for services, not care. We were not patients. We were clients of Roosevelt Community Mental Health, the underfunded and heroic government organization supporting the facility. 

Spinks never housed anyone currently serving sentences for crimes, making it theoretically safer than behavioral health wards where that is always happening. Yet, its lack of oversight made it unsafe nonetheless. Fights, sexual encounters voluntary and otherwise, opiates administered by staff and shared freely; street drugs inhaled in bathrooms with showers running; rap battles and acoustic rock and roll covers: almost anything could happen there, and rarely in a good way.

Spinks was not permanent enough to be an adult foster home, though it was categorized as such by the state of Michigan for myriad bureaucratic reasons. Such homes fall below the radar in a way behavioral health facilities cannot. Large ones like Spinks, as well as the smaller, more common variety, provide residents with continuous supervision, meals, the maximum autonomy possible considering the condition of the client. They also provide medications and transportation to the many appointments necessary for life in a community mental health system.

The primary goal of an adult foster home, admitted or not, is to avoid more costly institutional care. Spinks was not quite such a home, but it did fulfill this goal. Still, the place was more generous than a shelter, offering a room with a single roommate even if the food was inedible: powdered eggs and dehydrated potatoes for breakfast, for example. Food was food, beds were beds, rooms were rooms: the privacy was exceptional, so it did draw malingerers, people who feign mental health conditions for my old therapist’s favorite concept of secondary gain. 

The door to the outside world was always unlocked for anyone who wanted to leave, but if you were in Spinks, it was highly unlikely you had anywhere else to go. For most clients, Spinks was entirely voluntary. Suffering people were there to be around enough concerned people to feel safe, with one exception: 

For me, being under a continuing order of treatment from the State of Michigan changed that situation. It meant that legal problems would arise were I to leave Spinks against medical advice -- problems that would make it impossible to get my medication without being returned to Spinks. Worse still, if I were stopped by any policeman in the State of Michigan, I would be detained and involuntarily returned to Spinks. Fear of life without meds scared me more than cops, however, and kept me in place without a second thought about it.

I was fortunate in that I wanted to be there. I came in still psychotic and newly homeless. Spinks promised to take care of both problems. If I wanted to flee to another state, it could be argued that the entire issue would be resolved with a full-time job that had benefits. I couldn’t buy medication that I needed to stay in mental shape to work full time over the counter, however. St. John’s Wort wasn’t going to cut it. Without a job that had health insurance, I had become and would always remain too sick to get a job with health insurance. 

Remember that in 2007, I could not independently purchase coverage of any kind with my preexisting condition. Look at the numbers, and there was even more reason to stay in Spinks. If I got a job without insurance coverage, I would lose Medicaid if I made more than 900 a month in pre-tax income and have to pay for medications that cost about 3000 a month out of pocket. Without those medications, I could not work at all. That means I had to have $36,000 in disposable after-tax income to avoid disabling psychosis. 

Even if I made enough to afford medication out of pocket, there were reasons not to work. Disability alone paid 700 a month. Income that was enough for me to get medication took away 200 a month in food benefits. Disabled status would reduce rent for a studio apartment from 400 a month to 100 a month. Altogether, after taxes, disability offered more than $50,000 a year in after-tax income.

Michigan in 2007 was already in the middle of the financial crisis ahead of schedule. Houses were worth hundreds of dollars. Factories were closed or closing. Unless someone hired me without any qualifications to speak of during a terrible economy in an awful job market, or I made at least $70,000 a year, I was better off staying sick enough for disability. That is, assuming I got Disability at all, which was dependent on me being sick enough for it.

Nowhere but Spinks made sense to stay. At Spinks, fresh paperwork affirmed my homelessness as a matter of record for the Social Security Administration. Homelessness expedites disability claims. My destitution was all part of a plan, and I was about to meet the planners.

A day into Brinks, I met Dorothy, my social worker and therapist, and liked her at once. 

She told me that my treatment was to be handled by an intensive program that brought in their own doctors instead of relying on the staff at Spinks. This program was called ACT, Assertive Community Treatment. The goal of ACT is to reduce reliance on hospitals by providing round-the-clock services. This meant there was always someone to call on the phone and talk to instead of poor Brad. The hope was that ACT would reduce the worst outcomes of mental illness: homelessness, substance abuse, suicide, and homicide.

For people who could barely take care of themselves, let alone get to the pharmacy to fill prescriptions or find rides to appointments, ACT was a miracle. There are piles upon piles of academic papers offering evidence that it works. Some of the people there read such papers. Some even wrote them.

ACT had a fleet of cars for taking those they cared for from their homes to their doctors and back. The program also delivered medications directly to the clients, usually only a few days’ worth, so that the person getting the meds could keep track of what they had to take. The med drops also gave staff a chance to investigate how clients were taking care of themselves and their places. 

The typical client of ACT was the kind of person who never would have left the hospital in decades past. You had to have three in-patient psychiatric hospitalizations in one calendar year to qualify. Counting my stay just after the Satanist’s explosion, I had exactly that many. That I had been grouped among these folks was humbling, but like the program itself, evidence-based.

When first arriving at an institution like Spinks or the Unit, time seems to slow down. You start living in pain, moment by moment, conversation by conversation. Every new detail is something to take in; every new face is a story you want to hear. Even when you have been to the hospital a half dozen times like I had, this effect seems to hold. Perhaps the jolt of hearing that metal door clang behind you as you enter.

Then, slowly but like clockwork, time itself seems to accelerate. As the days and activities normalize into the steady drumbeat of feet on a long, purposeful march, everything becomes more forgettable. Soon, faces and narratives are blurring together. After weeks, months, you can barely recognize the expressions on faces.

Some of this is the intentional monotony. Some of it is the medications building up in the blood. But I’ve heard other institutions like prison offer the same effect, though I’ve never been. During an interminable stay, you stop caring as much about anyone else in there with you. They are just going to leave, and you are still going to be in Spinks. I wasn’t at that point yet when I unpacked my things in a new room overlooking the staff parking lot. In a way, the speed of time seemed to slow again as it had when entering the Unit. I had to take in some detail before everything melted from acceleration again.

For most, Spinks was an alternative to the mental hospital. It was where one went when not quite sick enough to need to be locked down but still sick enough to need to get away and get where there was constant observation. As such, the majority of people who came in there were reasonably well put together, more so than the average folks at the Behavioral Health Unit. 

There was another reason why people stayed in Spinks, however. If there were no beds in a proper adult foster home and no apartments open in the subsidized towers downtown, all the displaced had was Spinks. For those who lived in the place instead of a long-term bed somewhere else, stays in Spinks could last months. Usually, if someone needs that kind of shelter, they are pretty messed up. So Spinks is full of those too healthy for the Behavioral Health Unit or for those who would never be healthy again. It was now understood that I was among the latter.

Spinks was a squat red-brick set of blocks in the dead center of Downtown Roosevelt. The building used to be a college dormitory for a vocational college campus that had since sold the complex to the county and relocated to the eastern suburbs. It had a courtyard with a covered patio and an oblong patch of grass beyond that cement. This courtyard was fenced in with white wooden planks that had a padlocked gate. There were no trees or ivy, only hedges, but it still felt academic.

The man who did my intake was from a country once in the Soviet Bloc, though I cannot remember which one so much as I remember the vague twist to his words – somewhere between a French or a Russian accent while somehow sounding like neither. This social worker named Fred smoked often and quickly in the courtyard.

We each smoked on opposite ends of the patio, and then he walked over. He asked to do intake forms with me, and we walked to cram into his tiny office. The last time I had seen Fred, I was coming to Spinks for the first time, suicidal, not homicidal. Fred would hear none of this when we had spoken then. His manner had been curt and direct for a social worker, and he had spit what he thought was the truth to me through guttural consonants. His therapeutic advice, “Get over it; grow up; get a job: that’s life. It is what it is. Get used to it.”

His terrible, foolhardy guidance stayed with me as he took me back into the tiny box to do the standard intake paperwork. Fred was one of only two who remembered me from my first time in Spinks. I remembered Fred because he had all but shouted at me for taking what I had for granted; being weak-willed and soft; not taking advantage of the career opportunities there were for writer, paltry as they could be, and just generally lecturing me as if I were the prodigal son from a more realistic Bible.

This time, I glared at him as he flipped through my thick, thick chart from the several weeks before that.

“Still think I’m faking it?” I asked. After that, it was just routine. Fred never again treated me with anything other than gentleness, so much so that I almost wished he would give me another pep talk, even if it were less aggressive. But he must have had too many patients to admit too many people and do too much paperwork to really spend time with anyone at work. I would see him march from his office, through the main building, to the patio, each trip in lockstep with the last, and then light up, power through the cigarette looking something like a cigarette himself, thin and fuming, before disappearing back into the world of forms and pens.

At first, Fred recommended that I be disallowed any community visits whatsoever, even with staff. I was under court order and thus considered a flight risk. Everyone seemed to believe that there was a high probability that I would swing down from psychosis and kill myself, that such a collapse was inevitable and had to be prepared for. 

It did not help my case for community visits that I had inherited a poor reputation from the charts recording my twisted life in the Unit.  The head therapist, a doddering Ph.D. named Eli, took me aside on account of these reports. Eli, this therapist, wanted to make sure I was not going to pull the same sort of games at Spinks as I did under Joyce and Dr. Wynne. 

Eli was not short, but he was not tall, having the kind of middle-ground height that is hard to place in memory. He favored button-down plaid cotton shirts, usually with gaudy colors, never with a tie. His belly bulged a bit over his braided leather belt, but it was not so full that it hung entirely over the edge. Even from a distance, Eli smelled like fruit-flavored cigars, usually cherry, though the day he first approached me, he smelled of artificial peach flavor instead.

One of his first questions was quite aggressive.

“Mason, do you know what your IQ is?”

“One fifty-one. One fifty-four. Something like that.”

“Well, my IQ is that high, too. A little higher than that actually, one seventy-two.”

As soon as this interaction passed, I felt myself twisting up until I held the same frustrating tension that I had known in the hospital proper. I do not take well to condescension.

“I ask that,” Eli said, “because I see in you a problem that’s common to people as smart as us. A lot of why you’re here, Mason, is because you probably cannot communicate well enough with people who are beneath you, and so those people assume you are nuts.” 

He shrugged as if allowing himself the word was a meaningful indulgence. “People don’t like it when you talk down to them.”

“Then how can you expect me to like you right now?”

“Mason,” he said, leaning back, relaxed, as if he expected this question and could talk down to me all the more for how predictable I was being. “Mason,” he said again, “I am not going to be your psychologist. I just wanted to have this talk, you know, mind to mind, to let you know that there are people on the staff here who do understand you. Reasonable people.”

“The heart knows its reasons of which reason knows nothing.”

“Ah, nice. Dante.”

“Pascal, actually,” I said.

“I’m not sure about that, Mason.” He seemed to revel in using my name the way a talk show host might, trying everything he could to keep himself from forgetting yet another one. “The point I need to make is that you’re not going to make any friends being arrogant.”

I paused, fighting the urge to ask Eli how many friends his arrogance had left him with. Instead, I decided to play more games. “It is by self-forgetting that one finds.”

“Now that’s got to be Dante.”

“St. Francis of Assisi.”

“You know it is exactly this kind of thing that I’m talking about. Quotes to act impressive while your audience turns away. “

“Oh, but I save this kind of thing for only the best of minds.”

Eli laughed, something neither Joyce nor Dr. Wynne had ever done in session with me. I was warming up to him a bit. His heart seemed less dark than many of those who had tried to treat me in the weeks before that. I felt a sense of relief at this. That relief did not last.

“Speaking of quotes, I’m sure you’re familiar with Polonius from Hamlet? It is often repeated, even in recovery, ‘To Thine Own Self Be True.’ What people don’t take into account is that Polonius is a doddering old, proud fool, and the whole of the speech could thusly be called into question.”

“So, you’re saying I should be a fake?”

“I’d hoped that you would see it from a more encouraging angle. What I’m getting at, to be brief and sum this all up, is this little fact I have come to learn in my years of using as few words as needed, not to dumb down, far be it from the case, but rather to simplify. You might just need to act less intelligent than you are to fit in and be happy around Roosevelt. It has worked for me.”

Eli’s pale gray goatee spread open with a broad smile in its center. He looked proud of himself most of the time, but at that moment, his pride absolutely billowed off of him like gas off dry ice opened to the warmth of the world.

“Forgive me for choosing myself the fool I would rather follow,” I said.

“Why are you here?” Eli asked.

“Because I believe I am God, the Father come back to Earth to save humankind from itself.”

“But you don’t really believe that, do you? You’re smart enough to keep some insight into such a problem.”

“Eli, may I call you Eli?” 

He nodded.

“Eli, the world is in terrible shape right now, and it’s only going to get worse. When I get sick, I start to think that God meant for me to help. Even as I believe less and less that I am a literal messiah, I become more convinced that someone needs to rise up. Since I can remember, I have believed on some level that that someone is me. I have been, in a way, doing just what you think I should do now – hiding who I really think I am to pass in society. I am God, says the innermost part of me, and I must never be true to that. I would rather be real than free. Fraudulent freedom has gotten me this far – nowhere.”

“Well, we can’t help you if you’re not honest in here,” Eli conceded. “That is true. And I don’t tell just anybody to hide their brains – only people on our level. A survival technique – that’s all it is. Just find a place in yourself, somewhere peaceful and neutral, and build your life there.”

“The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of great moral crisis maintain their neutrality.”

“Voltaire?” Eli guessed.

“Dante,” I said and left to smoke a cigarette.

Spinks got one compliment from clients above all others: “At least you can smoke here whenever you want.” As an adult foster home rather than a hospital, patients were allowed to indulge in ways they could not - caffeinated beverages and various tobacco products were not supplied but were effectively encouraged. After a few days in Spinks, residents were allowed to leave for up to five hours at a time, enough of a window to purchase plenty of cigars and soda pop. 

Most of the folks drank Mountain Dew or its generic variety out of piss warm two-liter bottles. We did not have access to a fridge, and the staff were not allowed to let us store things in theirs, so this meant that hot and cold beverages were a precious commodity found only in the outside world.

Spinks brought out the chain smoker in most of its clients. Often, they smoked at a rate such that they could not afford proper cigarettes and turned to a tax loophole to keep going through packs each day: they bought little cigars, boxes of twenty with filters and flavors to cover how disgusting they were to inhale. It was only a matter of days before I realized that I was going to have to smoke those as well. Soon after arrival, I was pacing the patio in a pungent cloud of carbon monoxide and artificial peach flavoring.

There was a covered cement patio outside the main lounge. Under it were two circular tables, and around each of them were five chairs. Another row of chairs lined the back brick wall. Spinks housed less than twenty people even at capacity, so everyone could be outside and sitting at once, as they were when I left Eli’s company.

Inasmuch as the county had a plan for the progression of patients through the system, Spinks was meant to be a waypoint – not quite freedom, not quite hospitalization. Most spent a few days or at most weeks and then were gone. There were exceptions, and I was about to become one of them. Spinks was the only place left for me, whatever it was.

## Chapter 2

Everything changed after a new therapist met with me in an arts and crafts room at Spinks.

Dorothy was my first contact point at Assertive Community Therapy, or ACT. She had short but styled silver hair. With a delicate face wrinkled by years of difficult clients, she appeared to be no younger than sixty-five. Her blue eyes almost always looked to be crinkled and smiling, but this apparent warmth was just a function of how she had aged.

I surmised from her steady manner that she must have been treating people like me for several decades. 

The first thing I did was ask for her qualifications. She was taken aback but told me she had a master’s in social work. Then she asked me if I had heard anything or already knew anything about ACT and what it did.

“I heard that you guys are going to take over my life and control everything I do,” I said, repeating rumors I learned from people whom I’d met on the inside. The reputation of ACT was dreadful among young patients who wanted something they mistook for freedom; partying and traveling were not possible.

“I’m afraid we don’t have that much power,” Dorothy said as if she regretted that fact. Instantly, I could tell that if anyone deserved such power, it was someone as caring as her.

“I shouldn’t even be here,” I said. “I just got out of the hospital a lot sicker than when I went in, and I had most of a month to decompensate. I was denied anything more than a marginal dose of medication because I was told I was faking my illness to manipulate my family into giving me things - secondary gain, they called it. As if anyone would ever want to pretend to have what I have. Even doing that would be incredibly disturbing. Based on the last month, I have no reason to trust anybody and would be happy if you let me go on my way.” 

I began to stand, but Dorothy told me to sit down with surprising command coming from her small, frail body. I did. “Mason, you are court-ordered to be treated by us, so you do not get to go on your own way.”

I cracked my knuckles and shuffled my feet in my chair. I knew Dorothy was right, that I had to comply. I had simply forgotten that my care was now ordered to occur by law. I settled back into my seat.

Dorothy explained what ACT was. I asked when I would get to see a psychiatrist. “Soon,” Dorothy said, “but I will explain your concerns about the low dose of your medication to him when I get back to the office, and you should be on a much higher dose tonight.”

“That’s it?” I asked. “It’s really that easy?” I was relieved beyond words. For the first time since I had gone to the ER almost five weeks before, I felt as though somebody gave a shit about whether or not I got better. 

“They really do just dump problems like me on you guys at the hospital, don’t they? Their idea of a treatment plan is requesting a court order for someone else to do the treatment while neglecting the patient in the meantime to ensure the patient goes crazy enough to earn the court order?”

“I don’t hide my opinion on this. The Behavioral Health Unit seems to me to be a terribly run organization. We hear bad things about it every day. I usually don’t hear about experiences as disturbing as you’ve told me yours was. If we could do anything, anything to change the way that place is run, we would. But we can’t, and neither can you. Perhaps it’s time to move on.”

“That’s like asking a veteran to move on after they get home from a bloody war. I have dreams, Dorothy, where I am strapped to a stretcher again, and this time, instead of being left there for three hours, I am left there forever, and I know it is forever in that way you know things in dreams. I spend hours every day being told to kill people by a voice that claims to be the master of this world. When I got to the Unit, I only heard that once or twice a day. The anger problem that made me decide to get help in the first place has worsened, so that I am angry at many, many more people now and for the kind of justified reasons that make the anger even harder to get rid of. I cannot stop seeing this girl get beaten into her room so that she could be shot up with something. That was hell, Dorothy. I may never move on.”

“I am here just for that,” Dorothy said. “We are going to work together and often for a long, long time.”

Somehow, the length of my order, the year I was required to comply with treatment, seemed for the first time to offer some promise that I would heal during that stretch.

“There is something we need to get at very soon, though,” she said. “It’s in your chart that you believe you are, how did you put it, ‘God the Father come to save humankind from itself.’ I’m told that you sold some other patients on this in the hospital. I want you to think, Mason, think about this idea very intently: why do you want to save the world?” She asked the question so earnestly, as if considering putting it in my treatment plan as a goal

I sat there silent and felt my eyes glaze into a spacey stare. The Dark Lord was coming. I could feel it like a halo before a seizure. I told her it would be in her best interest to end the session.

“Why?”

“Because he’s coming.”

“Who?”

“Evil,” I said.

“I’m not scared of evil, and I’m not scared of you,” Dorothy said. It was the kind of statement that I had been waiting a month to hear – not a dismissal of my problem as faked but both an acknowledgment of what was happening and a firm assertion that it could be overcome. 

From the start, I had liked Dorothy. This amity had made me slightly more confident that what I was dealing with could be dealt with. After this last line, as we launched into the first of many sessions, I felt a peace like the brief one that came after morning devotionals, and I finally had hope that what I had could be treated.

Dorothy left me, but not before letting me know that I would soon be seen by a caseworker and the head of Community Mental Health. The former would be there to make a battle plan to overcome paperwork and get me some kind of benefits for my disorder. The latter met with everyone when they came into ACT and would be evaluating me as he evaluated everyone else.

I walked out of the room where Dorothy and I had talked. The air smelled of fall but felt like summer. Taking into account how skilled Dorothy seemed to be, I held hope that kept me going, hope that her care would let me get out in short order. 

Surely it would not be long until I was well enough to leave and take my mission to save the world to the streets where it belonged. It was apparent then why I wanted to save the world – because it needed saving, and there was no one else to do it. 

Above all, I felt heard. There is no more helpful feeling when hearing voices.

## Chapter 3

Marvin was a thick black man, slightly older than a boy, who spoke only in a breathy mumble. He was there when I got to Spinks and had already been there for a while. 

Marvin’s clothes were all supposed to be baggy, but because of his weight, stretched. I would guess he weighed a little less than three hundred pounds. Someone told me, though I no longer remember who, that he had been a cut stud in high school and had become overweight through only the medication’s side effects. 

At the end of each hall within Spinks was a convex mirror that allowed one to see around the corner. 

Several times a day, I would catch Marvin standing in front of one of these mirrors, looking up and examining his reflection from head to toe and back again. Sometimes he would be mumbling to himself as he did this. Other times Marvin would be forming words with his lips silently, and sometimes he was silent altogether. Always, it was clear that he had a purpose for staring as he did, though I never asked what that was, and he never volunteered the information to me.

Several times Marvin mumbled to me about his destiny, that he was going to be a rap star. Considering everything, I thought this unlikely. Staring into the exposed face of his delusions, I wondered if people saw me the same way, felt that I was a sad case for thinking I could make it in music. Sure, Marvin had far less talent than I did, but I was probably less talented than I believed and certainly getting old to try to be a big star. 

The thought of our similarity shook me more than once as I played my guitar anyway.

Marvin would borrow that guitar, and I would see him picking one note, then the other, then repeating the pattern to a steady rhythm and mumbling, that hiss still in his voice. Every few seconds, he would stop and congratulate himself by saying, “Yeah!” or “That’s it,” or some combination of the two. 

Then Marvin would go back to plucking the two-note beat and perhaps start to stomp out a muted thump with his feet. 

Once in a while, he would call me in and ask for me to flesh out the two-note songs. I have never had perfect rhythm and would have a hard time matching his exact pattern. When I couldn’t find the pocket, he would say, “Nah,” over and over. 

I have to admit the swing of his beats was subtle and unique, or it would not have been so hard to recreate them. But no matter how much work he put into his ideas, and he was almost always humming or tapping his hands, Marvin never seemed to get any better at playing the guitar.

From the start, Marvin took an interest in my music. 

Once I got to Spinks, I was allowed my guitar, and I spent hours upon hours each day playing it. Most of the time, I would be tightening up old material, but I also spent a few hours each day working on new material. Marvin would walk by as I played in the craft room or the room with the Nintendo 64 and come in. I would play him something of my choice, and he would either bob his head and get into the music or just cross his arms and shake his head. 

One time I must have played him a hundred originals. 

It was later in the night, and I had nothing left to do for the day but was not tired enough to sleep. The two of us were in a room sitting around, bored. I thought of Marvin’s contrasting reactions to a number of my works and wondered if there were a reason he disliked so many of them while loving so many others. So I decided to let him evaluate my entire catalog. 

I tuned up my old acoustic and asked him to say yes or no after the first few measures, giving his judgment of any song I played.

He cut down perhaps a half of my work, maybe more. After a while, I began to notice that the songs he liked were ones that had clever rhythms. Straight tempos seemed to turn him off right away. I would get what I considered to be my best songs shot down in a couple seconds with a “Nah” or worse yet, a “Nah, man. Nah.” 

It is rare for anyone to be honest about music. 

Usually, people would just say what I was doing was right and move on to general conversation. Marvin was more useful than that. I appreciate sharp opinions, and what he thought made me reconsider all of my compositions. Suddenly, I saw an aspect of music that I had often neglected up until that point. I can still see his face of disgust as he disapproves of a song that I thought everyone loved and hear his mumbled judgments.

Marvin was not the only would-be rap star in Spinks. 

Going back to the Behavioral Health Unit, I had known a tiny black teen whose voice boomed through the halls, a strange rage in his intensity of delivery and manner. I always felt when looking upon him in the middle of one of his flows that he was either going to kill me or start weeping. That was how twisted with emotion the kid was. 

His name was Isiah, but I was told over and over that his rap name was I-Bomb.

Apparently, he had gone into a studio when even younger and cut a full length, but this work had been lifted by the label who had paid for his time, and he was not even sure if he had the master anymore. Judging only from his delivery and the quality of his voice, I suspected that the lost album may have been something worth finding.

At first, I really thought Isiah was a genius. His content and wordplay seemed spectacular. 

Then, a nurse told me that half the time, he was just quoting Tupac. I called him on this shortly after that, and it appeared that his work got at once worse in cleverness but better in its intensity. I no longer got the sense that he was spitting canned words, which was how the better lyrics he had lifted came off. The rhymes were sometimes clunky, and the flow did not ride the silent beat quite as smoothly, yet he meant what he was saying, and that made him look even more threatening.

When I was eighteen, a friend from college named Sanford Smith stayed with my family for the summer of 1999. He had gotten an engineering internship at a local furniture plant near Roosevelt and needed a place to crash while he went through it. 

Sanford was a hip-hop junkie. This was back when mixtapes were tapes, and he would get new ones every week from the same barber from whom he bought weed. 

Sanford could drive a car and roll a blunt at once, no small feat of coordination considering that it involved removing tobacco from a thin casing as well as wrapping that casing back together with weed in it, all one-handed. 

We would drive around and listen to rap from those golden albums that kept dropping like long-needed rain in the nineteen-nineties. Sometimes Sanford would freestyle, and he was pretty good. I would try but could not keep up. Still, I started writing rhymes that summer, and Sanford seemed to really like what I was spitting. I learned enough about hip-hop that summer to last me a decade.

Because of Sanford, I thought I could talk with Isiah about that kind of music and not be shallow in my understanding. 

But the knowledge allowed me another skill: I had the form of typical raps down and could flow, at least on a page. Whenever I used to have an episode, I would start clanging - using involuntary wordplay, rhymes, and alliteration at inappropriate times. Due to this symptom of my condition, I could freestyle like a motherfucker, but only when unwell.

Of course, Isiah could not stop rapping either, which also seemed to be a part of his psychosis. 

So, we would battle for hours, at first sitting in the smoking room at the Unit, and later sitting on the smoking courtyard in Spinks. 

Every time I would freeze him up. I am not sure if it was just because of my patience or my skill that allowed me to tear him up and wear him down. I know it was never easy. He was probably used to his dynamite boom voice blowing others away. I stood my ground and sent my own explosion his way.

Isiah seemed less deluded than Marvin about his chances in the rap game. Isiah could actually flow and was even younger than the mumbler. Marvin seemed far more dedicated and industrious, but it never meant a thing. He never got any better. I seemed to get better at everything artistic, at least in my own estimation. 

I was devastating Isiah in our battles and writing song after song, most of which Marvin was digging. 

This was to say nothing of my visual or literary art. Spinks was becoming a sort of artistic retreat, and I found love for it as the pages and songs piled up, a love that I hoped could last until I had a way out and a place to go. What mattered more than when I got out was that my powers were increasing, which was going to make saving the world all the easier.

Meanwhile, someone was literally trying to save me. 

Beatrice showed up one day in the same way as Devin might. I was just told I had a visitor. There was a stocky redhead with freckles everywhere and eyes weary from endless family life.

We greeted each other, but she wasn’t my caseworker just yet.

“Mason, full disclosure: I know who you are. I knew about you back in High School when everyone knew who you were.” 

I had skipped two grades in some subjects and one in all and was in High School at twelve. I got a reputation for being smarter than I was and thinking I was even smarter than that. 

“If you don’t want someone who knows you to be your caseworker, someone else can do this. But let me share a little something with you, Mason. I’m not cocky. You might remember me playing point guard. I wasn’t cocky then either. What I am is the best damn case worker you could ask for, the one who gets more people disability than anyone else in CMH. So if you want to get this done…”

“I do. I don’t care. Let’s go.”

“So a caseworker is a lot like a point guard. I’m your point guard, Mason. This is how I am going to get you out of here.”

Beatrice then told me the secret to getting social security disability. Pay attention now: the secret is amassing paperwork supporting your case. She had 1,200 plus pages of notes from my boyhood therapist already on the way to the right office. The guy kept at least three pages of notes from every session I’d ever had, dating back over 15 years. Every session, I’d see those three, five, seven pages of notes. Apparently, he had actually filed all of them. Sending piles of paper to the government, he was my Social  Security Santa Claus.

With this priceless pile of data, my future was secure. My heart lightened slightly. There was still a great deal of weight ahead for me, but it felt like others were finally there to encourage me to push.

I didn’t need fans or followers like I wanted. I needed some of the rarer and nobler creatures on the planet: good-hearted bureaucrats. 

I was to see the waiting game of passing paperwork in the coming weeks, and Beatrice was as good as she promised. I only wished that there was a clock to run out.

## Chapter 4

The episode that put me in the Unit, and then Spinks, was punctuated by psychotic relapses. 

As soon as my new psychiatrist took the simple step of putting me on a responsible amount of psychotropic medication, I went from being raving to eccentric, but not for keeps. 

Instead of thinking I was the messiah, I worked hard on a piece of writing about someone who was the messiah. 

This sounds healthier, but my grip on reality is tenuous when I throw myself into fiction. I got lost in the plot. This story, though, was designed to be far too ridiculous and bizarre for me to ever confuse it with what was really going, or at least I thought it did.

The idea was simple: there is a race of super-intelligent microorganisms on Mars that have continued to evolve with a paucity of resources. The entire history of life from the Cambrian period on Earth was an experiment by them to produce multicellular intelligent life. 

Once they did, the next phase was to guide human history until a super-being who was an intelligent organism comprised of billions of super-intelligent cells could be perfected. To do this, the Martians had been getting inside animals and controlling brains, and intervening in history to preserve or advance the human race toward its own development of their goal. 

All was well until the US government discovered Martians and took them to be alien nanotechnology rather than sentient beings. The Martians were vivisected and reverse-engineered into powerful nanotechnology that the Government could use to control minds, grow buildings, and cure bodies. A super-being was made, but the Martians had built controls into it without the government knowing. 

When this being became independent of its orders, another was built without the controls, but this one went mad and conquered the world. 

The only hope for the Martians and the good super-being was to flee to another solar system, undertaking the first interstellar flight to a yellow star called Chara. Thus, the Martians achieved their goal of extending Sol-based life beyond our solar system, and the destiny of their program was realized. 

The only drawback was that it left Earth entirely controlled by a monster. 

The monster then came looking for the super-being, taking a ship faster than the super-being’s, thus getting there before the super-being, armed with future knowledge and better technology. The ensuing massacre drove the super-being back to Mars, which by then had been terraformed into an appropriate place to start a revolution. 

The tide turned when the super-being learned to reverse the control of the Martians and take over every single Martian in the Solar System and control them all with his individual, sentient cells, as the monster could already do. It was then little more than a videogame for him to remotely play billions of soldiers like action-figures and overthrow the evil government on Earth and Mars. 

The trap was then set for the Monster, who comes back from the other system and is destroyed in a spectacular final battle of mind-controlled legions. 

The tide turned only when the super being advanced to another level, being able to control all matter with his cells rather than just other people. In the end, the super-being turns himself into a being of pure energy through his newly mastered control of matter so that he can never be corrupted by his powers. 

I tried to explain this work of fiction to many, many people and failed in so doing. 

Most of the fellow schizophrenics with whom I spoke told me that I should not go around revealing secrets like the fact that aliens really do control our minds with impossibly small machines. The aliens did not like that, and neither did the government in control of the rest of the tiny, conscious robots. This, I was told in earnest.

In the first few weeks, I wrote drafts and character sketches for what I assumed would be an epic science fiction piece. What made the whole concept insane was that I intended for it to be not just a space opera, but a literal opera. The idea was called the Ringer Cycle, and I fought with different ways to incorporate a ring of power into the work without being too derivative. In the end, I described the two superhumans as ringers in a game between lesser creatures, and the ring in Wagner’s title became a pun in mine.

I spent hours composing what I hoped to be the first several songs for the opera. 

As I wrote more and more, however, I lost the cohesion of the early work, and I also suffered because I had no idea how opera worked or how it had developed. Still, the notion drove me and drove me hard. I started literally sketching characters. 

But when I began a treatment for the first of four parts, I could not help but write myself into it, and that did not work at all with a work that was supposed to be epic, not a personal exploration. The more I worked on the plot, the more my own avatar became ensnared in the web of narrative threads holding the peace together. Pretty soon, the old delusions came out, and once again, I found myself writing about my mission to take control of Iran and build a caliphate to bring down Western Civilization. 

In short, I went back to the same psychosis that had gripped me nine years before. 

I did not remember much of what I had thought when I was involuntarily hospitalized and had to withdraw from college at 17 or during my first hospitalization at 14. 

My mother, however, claimed to remember it all very well and was clear on the point that I seemed to keep going back to the same delusions over and over. Mom got so upset about the consistency that I was starting to hear her say things like, “Maybe it really is a demon,” and the like. She was reaching a point of almost joining in my psychosis, at least to the extent that she attributed it to an evil force separate from me.

This God and the devil issue gets very tricky, very fast. 

In religious West Michigan, as in many parts of America, the belief that the devil makes people do things is common. Also frequently asserted is that it is not insane to hear the voice of God regularly. People at the AA meetings I was attending in Roosevelt often attributed their struggles to what they called Spiritual Warfare – the daily battles between good and evil people as if good and evil were labels that Christians were even allowed to attach to people. The sense of right and wrong was so thick that it stank like an old library book. 

Still, people loved the musty ideas that got witches burned three-hundred plus years before. 

This, along with people’s insistence that the end times were at hand and that God was bound to come soon because the world was collapsing and corrupt, played a pivotal role in how my insanity was perceived. I honestly believe that people treated me worse because they thought I was a demonically driven weirdo rather than a sick and suffering man. 

Everything gets stickier when I start to look at what finally pulled me out of another bout of obsession with Jihads.

My new psychiatrist finished going over his copy of the 1,200 pages of notes from my first therapist and had a treatment plan that was to work. My medication was changed back to ones I hadn’t been on in years but always worked well for me. 

Dr. Wagonmaker was a devout Christian as well, having been raised Amish and wearing the clothes of the Amish, but with colors and patterns and buttons. He seemed so entirely bizarre that he had to be the only sane one in the building. His weirdness was somehow reassuring.

Dr. Wagonmaker would stroke his massive beard in a basement office at the community mental health offices and ask if God was a part of my treatment plan yet. The County of Agawatta paid for this advice. The craziest thing was that turning to Jesus Christ turned into the best advice anyone gave me. I found something that hurt the demon at last.

On better meds, I started to think more clearly about my psychotic mission, but it still would not leave me. 

I was still then hearing voices that I refused to report, feeling that honesty would only screw me over even harder than I had already been screwed. Now they were telling me to right the wrongs of the world, kill the evil people, and also pointing out who around me was evil and deserving to be murdered. This concerned me more than the symptoms that had brought me in and eventually brought me to my knees.

I genuflected and prayed, prayed hard, asking for God to not talk to me and for the devil to leave me alone too and any demons I was forgetting to mention, plus the delusions that I needed to conquer the earth and that I knew who was good or evil, and then asked over and over for peace within, to just live in the reality of others and know that reality is all I ever needed to know. 

I felt little effect at that moment, but about a day later, I realized the voices had been quiet all day. So, I did it again. And it worked again.

The irony of praying to God for His silence did not bother me enough to mess with something that was working at last. 

The medications stayed the same – high doses, but no tranquilizers, no sleeping pills, and yet I started sleeping well, eating consistently, and the whole of life opened up again. 

To be honest, it embarrasses me that I live in this cycle of asking to avoid what God and the devil argue is my destiny – for me to become some mystic leader who terrorizes the earth. I resent that I even have to bother with such devotionals, but I do, and I try to never miss them, as that means loudening whispers with evil or grandiose plans. But what haunts me the most is the thought that perhaps I am doing all this work to cower from God’s plan for me and that I cannot be set free because I am still swimming into the true current. 

## Chapter 5

I first saw Sarah in the morning group. 

Alvin was leading the discussion as he did every day but Friday. The topic was self-esteem. I was on a warpath of self-righteousness. I went off and on and on. 

The idea that loving oneself is essential to a healthy mind has always felt wrong to me. I accept myself, but if I fall into a complacent sense of contentment, I love myself right into the grave. People need to be driven by a questioning insistence of doubt, or nothing can come of a life other than reproduction. 

“If self-esteem kept me sane, my picture would be in the dictionary under ‘sanity’.”

Sarah laughed at this but did not make eye contact with me or even turn her head in my direction. I was not done, not even close, but the woman in the room gave me pause. Thick, long, straight red hair and wide-set almond eyes whose color looked to be green even from a dozen feet away: she was fetching. 

I could not let that distract me from the goal at hand. I still had to cross-examine this unfortunate mental health worker even longer, for I was not sure I had convinced him that what he was purporting hurt rather than helped.

Point one, spat at poor Alvin: “You make people feel bad because they don’t feel good about themselves.” Self-esteem is a self-defeating cycle of holding oneself to an impossible standard, and in so doing, the belief that it is needed only makes sufferers love themselves less for never being able to love themselves enough.” I was not confusing it with arrogance, which was its own problem that was as serious as genuinely loving yourself.

Point two, yelling now: “If I were to accept myself as I am, implicitly, I would be inferring that my current existence is acceptable even though I find it to be quite the opposite.” The key to a motivated life is not loving self but striving to make the self more loveable all around. To love flaws, to lovesickness, to love everything unconditionally inside a mind is setting the standard so low that nothing was necessary to become better, if cowed and controlled, could be construed as healthy.” 

Point three, composing myself: “This place, and every hospital, is about control, not confidence. We are led to blindly accept platitudes with dangerous implications. Doing so transforms acceptance of acquiescence into concessions of inferiority, concessions that are, obviously, a social construct designed to imprison us even when we leave.” 

The room looked at me like I had just started screaming like a chimpanzee, impossible to understand and inherently inferior by my very nature.

“You think too much,” said a redneck whose features I have forgotten.

“There is no such thing as thinking too much.”

Point four, standing and ready to leave for a cigarette: “Ultimately, believing in yourself just as you are is a form of resignation. It is the realization of what needs to be hated about myself that keeps me from giving up on my recovery. The only way for a person to heal is to first recognize the parts of the self that don’t deserve any confidence whatsoever. And the kind of counselors who don’t deserve any confidence either.”

By now, the other patients were getting riled up. I had found a way to rally them out of a morning torpor, a feat in itself. It may have only been the rise in my voice that was changing the room, but the change was there regardless.

The closing point, made before I left: “I am being punished for honesty and offered a deathtrap as the best-case scenario. If you think I am going to love the part of myself that got me in this double-bind, you’re the crazy one.” 

Then I was gone around the corner and heading out to the smoking patio. 

The sock never really left my heart. 

When bound and frustrated, I could feel it in my chest. I would close my eyes and see the small diabetic woman being knocked around by staff until they got the symbol of resistance off of her. I felt not the slightest remorse for such violence. 

In fact, that woman had healed remarkably in the following weeks, and so had I, for that matter. 

I was no longer interested in saving the world with delusions as powers and hallucinations as guides. I had enough gifts, I was sure, that I could, at the very least, make the world a much better place through the very mind I was being told was my problem. I waited for the new girl to join me out there, but she never came. 

I had yet to learn that she did not smoke. This is extremely rare among psychotics. 

So, I mingled with the other patients, taking high fives for giving the staff hell without the slightest acknowledgment that my points were understood. The defiance alone was all that mattered to most of them. 

The difference between Spinks and the Unit was that in Spinks, they saw my wrath as a sign of self-advocacy and a coping skill that was helping to motivate my healing rather than a behavioral problem that had to be corrected. 

The staff was there with smiles and questions when I went into the kitchen for lunch. Sarah was there, and I decided to sit across from her. I did not engage her in conversation, however. She broke the ice with me when she heard me complain about still hearing God.

“You hear him, too?” she asked. 

I nodded.

Later she took me aside and told me that she needed to talk about what she was being told she was. Sarah had made it through twenty-four years being almost continuously delusional and hallucinating with drastically unstable emotions - without seeing a doctor about those problems even once. Now she was being told she had psychotic bipolar disorder and was very confused.

This is not the first thing she said to start our first conversation. Instead, she bore terrible news. 

“I know when people are going to die. You’re not going to make it to forty, so if there are things you want to do, get busy doing them.”

I just nodded. Somewhere else, a party perhaps, this might have been a joke or the start of a debate. 

In a hospital setting, however, I knew that Sarah really believed that she had the powers she described to me. Though I was curious to know what else she thought she could do, I knew at that point that I would have to win her confidence to try to tease out more delusions of supernatural powers that were there within her.

So I did what I learned to do in AA when trying to earn the confidence of someone whose experience had been at times similar to my own: I told her about my problems. 

“Sometimes, I think I can tell instantly whether someone is or is not a born-again Christian. In fact, I always think I can. I just get this intuitive twinge that I am in the presence of godliness, or I don’t. So, I know how they will be judged, and you know when. We could make a great team.”

“They say it is psychotic bipolar disorder. I don’t know why. I’ve never in my life been told I was sick. In fact, I usually feel very, very happy.”

“Have you ever felt better than good?” I asked.

Sarah nodded. “All the time. It’s the best feeling there is. I always have except for when I get the blues.”

“Do you ever feel like your thoughts are going too fast for other people to keep up with them?”

“And then they think I don’t make sense,” she said, “when they are just not trying hard enough to follow me,” Sarah added, finishing my sentence.

“What about this: do you feel you have a special mission and purpose for being alive – that God has a quest you must complete?”

“If I do, I wouldn’t tell anybody here about it.”

I looked hard at her then. 

Her eyes were pale green, like wads of spearmint gum with black marbles stuck in their centers. She seemed upset with me as if I had read her diary and was using the information to ask leading questions that could get her into trouble. 

I had done nothing of the kind, of course. I was just running through the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. I kept on my way through them, and she answered every question with a yes.”

“You have bipolar disorder,” I said, “and you are intermittently psychotic.”

“Hearing God is a good thing,” she said weakly as if trying more to convince herself than to convince me. “I take Christianity very seriously.”

“God does not talk to people anymore. Have you not read as much in Revelations?”

“Well, what about you? What do you hear?”

I paused and gulped. I should have realized in advance that the whole conversation was going to turn back on me and sour the acquaintance before it was barely made. “Hallucinations,” I said.

“Yeah, but what do you hear in them?” she asked.

“The devil tells me to kill people. I don’t. Mother Mary gives me relationship advice. I don’t take it. Jesus Christ talks about my heart. God… God tells me who I am and what I must do. But nothing else – I only hear those illusions, just specific Christian religious figures. Want to play Nintendo?”

Sarah nodded. She took off her sweatshirt, and I watched her form shift beautifully. At a certain point, it becomes difficult to tell whether the women who are around in the hospital are as lovely as they seem. 

Being deprived of contact with most of the world, those left behind take on a certain desert island attractiveness. They seem to be the last ones on earth and thus look better than they would otherwise look. Even with this in mind, however, Sarah looked good.

## Chapter 6

It was around the time that I met Sarah when I lost the belief that I had two specific supernatural powers. 

The first was my sense of other people’s location. When I was in Spinks, I would hear a voice say, “Sarah is in the kitchen eating from a bowl of popcorn,” and there I would go, and there it would be. Or even, “Your parents will be arriving for visiting hours in three seconds,” and so it went. 

In retrospect, I have a hard time believing that this supposed ability was anywhere near as sharp in reality as I remember it being. Strangely, it also went away when, about a month into my stay at Spinks, I was put on a medication that took away most of my other delusions. 

The other supernatural power, first voiced to Sarah, was far more sinister in its potential for harm and impossible to confirm the way I could my remote location. I believed, again, only until my medication changed, that I could tell instantly whether or not someone had accepted Jesus Christ as their personal savior. 

Had I been a more virulent psychopath, I may have used this supposed knowledge to punish unbelievers, or perhaps even eradicate them. 

As I was, however, I harbored no ill will toward those who are not Christian. Instead, I found the ability curious and only used it in so far as I could test its accuracy. At the time, I remember discovering that it was, in fact, entirely accurate, at least in the sense that everyone who I thought was saved said they were. 

This, too, in retrospect, is hard for me to believe.

Both powers came in handy during my brief obsession with Sarah. When I wanted to chat with her, I would know where to look or if she was in her room and could not be disturbed. So I would go where the kindly voice said to, and there she would be. 

While she ate ice cubes, we would swap stories of holy revelations and speculate whether or not we would have been treated the same if she was a nun or I a priest, and it was hundreds of years ago. 

The idea that mental illness in the right historical context was a tool for starting religions is an old, tired one. Still, when you are wracked with religious psychosis and searching for answers, it does not matter how old and tired an idea is if it gives comfort. 

I also could sense the pure faith in this lovely woman, how she ardently practiced Christianity, and how strongly she believed that what others saw as symptoms were her own set of Godly magic tricks. 

The most disturbing one to me, as mentioned, was the one that she claimed informed her of when people die, and that compelled her to notify me that I would not live until forty. There had been such conviction in the prediction that I could not help but be taken with it and also want to know more about her.

I even quit smoking to impress her. 

There were other reasons to quit, of course. I had no money and had to scam and plead to get any cigarettes at all. When I had them, the other people there hung around me like crows around roadkill, and I seemed to put up about as much resistance to them as a dead deer could. 

I had been going through cigarettes daily by the dozen, pack after pack after pack, and only half of them for me. Also, my smoking had always been a point of contention between my parents and me, and I was looking for every way I could to placate them. They already had enough to worry about with voices telling me to kill them, showing them that I would make an effort was the least I could do. But really, the immediate gratification I got from denying myself of another kind was to become closer to this woman.

Sarah had an array of talents, much like the ones I did – she sketched and wrote poetry and sang, all very well, I was to see. 

So, we found ways to pass our hours: hanging out in the craft room doing pointlessly detailed portraits of imaginary people in crayon; messing around with my guitar and her voice even though our styles clearly clashed – she was operatic, and I was more of a troubadour, and even the occasional back and forth of strange phrases the could have been the seeds of poems themselves. 

Yet, as we sat through more groups together, it became clear to her that I had it in for the staff. 

After I berated Alvin, who kept the groups going with enthusiastic tolerance, she asked me a few concerned questions. To her, there seemed to be no reason for anyone to be as belligerent as I was with people who were obviously so kind and caring. Why did I feel so compelled to savage people like Alvin, who came off like a saint?

What I said to her had already occurred to me, but my having to use it as justification made me question the way that I was participating. I told her that if she knew how badly I had been treated at the Behavioral Health Unit that she would not wonder why my cynicism about groups was expressed so vocally and intensely. 

She could not know how bad it had been for me in there. 

Of course, I knew I was taking out poor treatment on the wrong people, those who just happened to be treating me after I was mistreated. When I brought this up with the Spinks staff, most told me that my experience was more the rule than the exception – that no one had kind words for their stay at the Unit. 

The best compliment anyone offered was that they did not mind it, not that it had helped, but that it had been tolerable. Sarah had not had this experience, but she made an excellent point. I should not keep taking revenge on the Spinks staff for things that others had done to me. 

The best women bring out the best in me, and Sarah was doing that.

The closest I ever came to her happened the first night that they put her on sleeping medication. 

Evening meds were taken, and she took the seat next to me and pronounced the name of the new drug with exaggerated elocution until the product name sounded silly. I told her she should go to bed right away on that med, that she could collapse at worst and would black out at best.

“I won’t blackout,” she said and later told me that that was the last of her memories for the night.

We ended up talking for hours. 

Sarah told me all about her current boyfriend, his idiosyncrasies: the ones she loved, the ones she loathed, and the ones she just tolerated. He was a bass player in a local band, and she had always liked musicians. From there, she shared about all her relationships, comparing her current one to those before him, and giving all the reasons why her present man never seemed to measure up.  

That night Sarah talked with a frankness that made her sound as though she had had just the amount of wine needed for someone to disregard social graces in favor of the truth. As she went on, I could not pull myself away, infatuated as I was, but also could not help but feel wrong for gaining such access to her mind without earning it in any way. 

At one point, she leaned into me and just stayed there, head on my shoulder. She started to flop on top of me, unable to hold herself up any more under the weight of the pills. It was then that I excused myself out of a sense of honor. I could allow myself the intimacy of her personal secrets but not bear the thought of having used her drugs to touch her.

The next day, I asked her about a few minor details from what we had discussed while she was drugged. They were nothing significant, but her unawareness when asked indicated information that she did not remember giving me. I asked her how much of the night she had lost.

She rested one finger on her chin, pointing to the slight cleft in it, and said the memories stopped just after she said, “I won’t blackout.” 

I told her she had gone a little far in what she said and, by the end, had been falling all over me. 

I meant that she had almost collapsed onto me, but she seemed offended, as if I had accused her of doing something awful. 

This was the only time I saw her angry, but she was that way. Her thick lips thinned, and her short nose went up, and she was gone and distant for the rest of the day.

When night came, the voices told me she was out on the smoking patio with a few other women. I sat in the midst of all of them and apologized for what I had said. I knew Sarah believed in mercy; I had since the voices told me she was a good Christian woman. She forgave me, of course, and the friendship resumed its intimate course.

The day she was released, I found her and told her how much I loved her. 

In response, she reminded me of the bass player whom she dated, and I thought of the disparaging words about him that she would never remember saying. Then, Sarah told me I didn’t know her well enough to love her. Again, I thought of the symptoms she might never admit that we shared. 

How well I knew her, she would never realize. 

She gave me her phone number and told me to call her in a year when we both had healed. I remember knowing at the time that neither of us would be healed by then, but it sounded like a good idea so long as I had a way to find her again. 

Of course, I made it a month without calling her, and I called her perhaps four or five times and only got one call back. Sarah had no cell phone. It was the number of her parent’s house. 

I will never forget asking her mother if she was there and being told she could not talk even though she was. Sometimes I wish there was a pill to take such moments away.

## Chapter 7

I was allowed to leave the grounds the day after Sarah left. 

By that time, I had my laptop with me. Also, there was an AA meeting within walking distance. From the start, I was given the maximum number of hours typically allowed a patient – five. 

Typically, I took them all at the beginning of the day. I would take my morning medication around seven in the morning and walk the four little city blocks to the meeting place. 

Along the way, I passed the massive county jail right at the time that all its eligible prisoners were being released to work if they had jobs. 

The sidewalks would crowd only for a few minutes with mostly black men who mostly had no coats. I worried often that my high-quality parka would be stripped from me, but none of these men ever so much as looked me in the eye, let alone spoke to me. 

There are pictures of me from those times, and I have this maniacal look as if I were the expansionist dictator of a theocracy: raging with ambitious and dangerous madness in my eyes. I may have looked scary to even them as I walked that gauntlet.

The place I was going was an AA group called Water Town that met five times a day. 

In the years I had attended other meetings around town, I had heard about Water Town and its reputation for sheltering homeless troublemakers and prescription drug dealers, and had never ventured into Roosevelt’s blighted downtown to visit it. But stuck in Spinks, without a car, the destitute were my neighbors. Now, after having been crammed into rooms with the worst of the worst cases, I began to feel at home among the homeless and the over-medicated. After all, we were all living on discount snack cakes and legal downers. 

Some of the Water Town members had been in the Unit.  Others had all of the same problems but had never been sent there for care.  

For the first time in my life, my pride had been trampled enough that I could go to meetings with that crowd and feel like part of that crowd.

After the meeting, I would walk to the library. Aside from serving as the headquarters of what felt like a homeless union, the place had free wireless internet. So as crowds of shaggy street rats scurried around and whispered, circled up and conspiring, I sat on my computer and checked social networking websites. 

The first day I was allowed to leave Spinks and go to the public library, I used the WiFi on my laptop to chase girls and wreak havoc. 

Once connected, I learned that I already had a MySpace message from that nurse whom I met in the bathroom of the Behavioral Health Unit. She had sent me her two phone numbers and asked for me to call her soon. My flip phone had been returned by the Pontiac Police by then, as they no longer needed it for evidence against the Satanists who stole it from me, so I put the precious phone numbers into my contacts. 

After scanning through a series of other MySpace messages of no consequence, I wrote a short, incoherent paragraph that I thought was brilliant and posted it as a MySpace blog entry. 

I was done with social media but still had more disturbing connections to make. Feeling a need for more sympathy at that painful time, I did something extreme. I sent out a mass email informing everyone in my address book that I had been involuntarily committed. It felt like a good way to rekindle some tenuous relationships. 

This took up the better part of my morning, and by the time I returned to Spinks, I had no time left to leave again.

As the days piled up, I received an interesting letter from my father’s friend who ran the recipient rights office at the hospital. I had filed several formal complaints against those who I believed had treated me poorly. In the letter in my hands, two of the four complaints had been disregarded because I had not quite understood the code I claimed was being broken. 

One of them I was advised to take up with the state bar, because it was a serious implication of the public defender who had shown up fifteen minutes late and offered no counsel. 

One complaint, though, was being taken into serious consideration: the denial of my transfer to a different therapist upon request. Apparently, they had gotten this complaint about Joyce before, and the matter was going to be addressed. 

I did not, however, feel vindicated by these acknowledgments of my disastrous care in the Unit. My life had been destroyed for doing the right thing, and consideration of one complaint was all I was given as consolation. 

Throughout my stay in the Behavioral Health Unit, I had kept every paper I had been given that documented my case and had Xeroxed most of my chart as well. I kept this close, hoping that somehow the paperwork would offer a lawyer a case for malpractice. 

As I read the psalms that call for struggle, I felt as though God was on my side. My cause was just, and my fight a necessary one. How many other helpless patients were being denied medication because Joyce thought they were faking it? I felt I owed them, and myself, justice.

Also, around the time of my time out, I began to meet with Dorothy three times a week. She bore the brunt of my quest for reciprocity. “You’re not Batman,” she once said.

I would go on and on about how I had been foisted into the machine of the mental health system unjustly. 

My care had been forced into existence only because I did the responsible thing and sought help when I was starting to hear voices that called for murder. To treat this, I had received none of the kind consideration Dorothy was giving me. Instead, I was confronted, and that confrontation was somehow supposed to help my anger problem. And so on.

At first, Dorothy just let me rage, asking only what emotions that were behind a given rant. Most of the time, I would offer up concepts like they were emotions, and she would demand something closer to the request. During these weekly interactions, I was to learn that insecurity was not an emotion, and neither were feeling alienated or misunderstood. 

Behind them were fear, loneliness, and the like. I am not quite sure how the acknowledgment of what I was feeling helped, but it did. I suppose it might have worked similarly as the admission of specific facts early on in AA does.

With my phone back in my life, I began to lean heavily on a few people. 

One important man who supported me was in the program. Before I had relapsed, I had a sponsor I rarely called. When I went back to drinking and then returned to recovery, I thought it would be best to start fresh. So I picked a hard-ass southerner named Lee and kept him even though I called him even less frequently than I called Jack. 

With John, I had not called because I thought I had my alcoholism beat and was getting complacent. With Lee, he never seemed to say anything unless I asked for his advice, which was usually too harsh that I did not want to know it in the first place. 

Still, Lee stayed with me, brought me cigarettes a few times when he visited me in the hospital, and he gave me a great if obvious bit of advice that had been very tough to take: Lee told me to concede all my points to my doctors and follow whatever they said to do, partly because they knew more than I did, and partly because I did not know what was good for me and could not figure it out stuck in my own frame of reference. 

I was, in short, there for the medical help and would be a fool not to behave as such.

When I started calling John again, it was not for his advice. On a walk to the morning meeting, I remembered that he worked the third shift and would probably be game for a phone call right when he got out of work. This proved to be the case. 

So, I would trade hands that the phone was in to keep them from the cold and cooling weather, and we would talk for several minutes at least. 

As it happened at that time, John had a terrible schedule for hitting meetings and had used that schedule to fall away from his support groups. As full of myself as I was in those days, I dressed down this man who had twenty years more sobriety than I for being complacent in his program. Then we would each complain eloquently. 

John was game to talk at that time every day, and so we did. So, my relationship with John evolved naturally into a deeper and deeper friendship, while my every disagreement with my mandatory treatment drove Lee and me further and further apart.

My relationship with Lee hit its worst point when I refused to acknowledge that there was any power higher than humans except for God. He told me I couldn’t hold a cup of coffee the way a mug could. I told him humans made that cup of coffee, and so were more powerful than it. 

It went on like this until Lee’s usually calm demeanor began to intensify toward something like anger, a loudening annoyance at least. 

Finally fed up with me, he began to yell something with a finger pointed my way: “Get dumb. Get dumb. Until you get dumb, you’re not going to get sober.”

“You are just wrong!” I shouted. “The literature says that God gave us brains to use, that reason is a powerful tool, that the will directed toward God’s is a good thing. You know all that. I am right. You are wrong. The conversation ends there.”

I thought already at that moment, the old AA saying I had always disliked: “It is better to be happy than right.” 

I felt as though I were opting for the best choice even as the program dictated that I was making the worst one. Yet Lee had told me to learn from the hospital, and I had learned a lesson that changed my life: I am my own best advocate, and if I do not advocate for myself, no one else will. 

So Lee was driven from me by his own suggestion. I fired him and hired Jack the next day. I could not know whether I was saving my program or damning it. I did not care. 

I just wanted to want AA again.

## Chapter 8

When I left New York, I was dragging an anchor of debt behind me. 

Instead of financing my education with student loans, which I could have spent frivolously, I financed my education with credit cards, which I did use frivolously. Most of the money had been spent on a computer, but I also went on spending jags typical of manic episodes, collecting absurd books and assembling absurd outfits.

The summer after graduate school, when I was living without a job, I added thousands to this debt, buying cigarettes, energy drinks, iced coffee, and gasoline with the cards. By then, I was getting sicker. When the time of lending ran out, I had owed about ten thousand dollars. 

Some of these my parents paid, and some of them they left to default. Their idea was that saddling me with bad credit was the only way to keep me from getting into trouble again.

Just before I went into the Unit, one of the cards whose balance was paid was sent to me again – a credit card for a clothing store. It had a nine-hundred-dollar limit. I pocketed the card with the half-hearted intention to run up another balance, but there were no franchises of the store in Roosevelt, so I had to bide my time until I could go on a jag again. I was having a hard time getting rides to AA meetings, let alone another town, so it felt unlikely that I would be able to throw the money away any time soon. 

Then, a door opened for me. 

I was summoned to go to Pontiac to testify against the Satanist who had stolen my telephone. Apparently, he had been picked up for a violent crime. I knew that it was not for my particular case but assumed that they were collecting evidence to demonstrate his criminal background. 

I was not sure, though. I just knew that I was expected to be in an Oakland County courtroom on a day in mid-November. Contact with my family still being limited. I ended up having to ask Devin to drive me there. 

We left before dawn, having to appear in mid-morning. 

We had gotten the directions to the place through a printed-out search on the internet, and they got us to a courthouse. No sooner were we there when someone at the front desk told us that we had the wrong courthouse for that particular case. 

After several questions, we were told that the site could not be looked up online and that there were about a half-dozen other Oakland County courthouses where the proceedings may have been underway. We had too many places to go in too little time, so we had nowhere to go at all. 

I doubted I was a crucial witness to anything, though considering the number of mailings they had sent me, perhaps I was. Regardless, I never went.

I ended up taking the day out of Spinks and Roosevelt as a sort of vacation. I suggested we go shopping with my card. I wanted Devin and me to have matching suits for performances. He entertained the idea and on the way back west, we stopped in Lansing, where there was a franchise of the clothing store that had sent me a new card. As I pondered the selections, I asked Devin what he wanted to wear.

“I don’t want to wear matching suits at all, Mason.”

“Then I’ll just get one for me,” I said. 

Then, there in the store, under our breath but still forced, I went after Devin for declining a gift. I could not understand why he would turn such a thing down. Finally, it came out.

“Mason, I am not in a band with you. I never have been. I’ve just helped you a lot. That’s all.”

The words did not register just then, not as they should have, anyway. 

I was delusional enough in those days to believe that I could be better without Devin than with him. The group we had been building and the songs I had been writing, and the work I had been doing for the last year was going to feel like a waste in a matter of hours. 

Nowhere in me was any consideration for Devin’s work and how his subordinate role in our outfit would have made him feel. When I am twisted by pressuring moods, I have a hard time putting myself in someone else’s perspective. I was no different that day. I just thought of all the photographs and recordings that were all but useless. I thought of my problems and then wanted to blot them out with recklessness. 

So I just went on shopping. Then a phone call came. 

I had been trying to get a hold of an old acquaintance in New York City for the week before the shopping spree. Seth was an A-list photographer who I knew through AA. He had sponsored my sponsor. Also, Seth had done a photoshoot for Devin and me a year before only because he liked our music. 

I knew from hearing him tell his story at an AA meeting that Seth had, during his first year sober, become convinced that he was the messiah. I badly wanted him to relate his experience in hopes that his way out of it could also be mine. After all, Seth had become wildly successful after being a basket case given up on by all who knew him. Not only did he offer hope, but he also provided grandiose dreams, the kind that an unwell person craves more than reasonable expectations. 

So, I began to tell him my story. 

The phone call must have lasted for a while because Devin left the clothing store and was pacing around in front of the mall’s other shops, looking increasingly annoyed. The matching suit suggestion had brought up something that seriously bothered him. My selfish commandeering of his day had rankled him, for sure, as had my persistent madness. Like most of the people in my life, he only wanted the Mason he knew back. No one of us would ever get that.

After I described what had happened to me, Seth sighed loudly and started his surfer speak, which usually consisted of deep insight punctuated by frequent use of the word “man.” 

He told me that this was because I had relapsed and that the only way he found to get better was to stay in hospital a long, long time – longer, he insisted, than I thought I had to.

Before he let me go, I asked him to answer one question for me: “Why do you think we think we are messiahs?”

After an even louder sigh, he said, “Man, I don’t know. I’m not God. I know that. But man, the only thing I ever came up with is this: early on in my recovery, I was so overwhelmed by the need for a God I didn’t believe existed that I felt I had to be him or he wouldn’t be there at all. That’s about it, man.”

We said goodbye. I had the reason I was unwell. It felt right, the way it feels when friends tell stories that could not have come from their imaginations. 

Facts dropped heavy into my mind, their cold inertia condensing and distilling the vapor of memories and dreams. My madness was not a mystery. I was left dizzy from the drop of barometric pressure in my mind. 

But I was still a mess – I skipped from life-changing realization back into the role of manic shopper.

I found the best choice of a suit for myself, one that I could not have afforded to buy both of us. It was a handsome brown, perfect for fall, and with everything I threw on top of it – shirt, tie, even socks, I still had only spent a little over six hundred dollars. I had a feeling that the card would be useless after one purchase, that something would happen to prevent me from using the whole of the nine hundred dollar limit, so I looked for a way to do so.

Devin had a sister named Allison. She was beautiful. She was also nine years younger than I was. 

A few times, she and I had practiced together, and I thought we had the potential to get a real country duo going. She would be the face, and I would do the rest. Devin had worked with us, with reservations. He never liked the lineup. It reminded him of Peter, Paul, and Mary, and he hated Peter, Paul, and Mary. 

I liked the lineup because I liked being with Allison. I had a crush on her, and the contact kept that going. 

I had recently gotten her number to try to practice again. I wanted to make sure that happened. So I decided to buy Allison a gift with the rest of the money on the card. 

I floated the idea by Devin, and he just laughed. 

There was nothing new to him about a friend pining for his sister. After he assured me that it bothered him not the slightest, I went searching for the right item. I picked out a sort of Jackie O. jacket and dropped the rest of what I had on it. The total came to nine-hundred dollars and change, which I had to fish out of my pocket and count up, coming within a few pennies of being short but just making it.

From the store, we drove straight back to Devin’s house. 

I had told Allison I was bringing her an early Christmas present, and she was to meet us there. Everyone was hoping, I suspect, that her boyfriend would not be there when I was. She had a boyfriend. He was something of a violent oaf, and I was chancing a punch in the face for this outpouring of consumerist love. 

We got there perhaps an hour before he did. I gave Allison the jacket, and she insisted on trying it on for me. She loved it. I had chosen a jacket because it would not be the wrong size. I guessed right. She was small where she was supposed to be. Clad in my purchase, she agreed to hear a few songs I had written for her to sing. We sat in the basement, and she listened. As I played, I looked at her once but could not look long. 

When I finished, she told me something I used to hear often when I was more sane and thin: “You’ve got a gift, Mason. You really could make it.” 

I have a history of taking appreciation of my art for romantic affection, and this was another of those moments. 

Of course, it would not last. 

Still, I reached out my hand and stroked her lip, a move that I would never have made sane, and told her it was too bad she had a cold sore. We sat for a while longer, perhaps a half-hour, until she excused herself to attend to her phone and its messages. Her boyfriend must have been really hitting her up, as I would be doing over the coming weeks.

After my flirtation, creepy and crafty as it was, I went upstairs and found Devin. 

He was at his computer, checking some sites. He asked how it went, and I gave a run down, to which he just nodded and smiled. His smile seemed so bright and wide that I could detect not the mildest sense of annoyance.

We had a lot to talk about – the break-up of our group, my inevitable marriage to his sister, Seth’s explanation of the inexplicable – I did not know where to start. It was another of those days whose events were to change the life to come. 

Some days feel more important than entire months, even entire seasons. 

I still had several hours before I had to be back at Spinks, and we were about to make another move that would change my musical ambitions even more. That was what held all this together: I dreamed of saving the world through art and was willing to use anyone and anything along the way to effect salvation.

## Chapter 9

The heart is a strange organ. Its nerves pump it without a connection to the brain. 

I am looking for the reason that I got so angry with Steve, but I am finding only emotions. Anything that felt like a justification then feels like a rationalization now. 

The cold fact is that I had thought about killing Steve for months before I went into the Unit. 

It had been a joke to me, if only to me. I told a few friends about it as if telling a joke, and it disturbed them enough that I never told anyone again. At least, I did not tell until it wasn’t a joke anymore. 

Some impulses move hearts without thoughts, as might a clot. We beat ourselves.

It began when I left Allison’s side. Her boyfriend had come over, and I had rejoined Devin in his bedroom. I could still smell that woman even as the piney stink of Devin’s cologne filled my head. The room was cold, colder it felt than it had been outside. The windows were open, and a breeze pulsed the blinds from time to time. 

Out the window stretched a narrow lake that looked more like a wide river. I thought of summer and bathing suits, and Allison again, and then she was gone, and all that remained in me was restlessness. I wanted to move, but being unable to go anywhere far away, I decided to make changes instead.

I took a seat next to Devin at his computer, and he pulled up the website for Houndstooth Records. 

I had put much of myself into the company, but the company had also worked me over. I was consistently invalidated by Brad and Biff. The initial bravado that I had brought to my startup was now seen as arrogant. Each move I proposed needed to be analyzed for the slightest sign of self-assurance. Everything I did to help was scrutinized for traces of madness. We were so busy covering our back that we broke it every time.

There we were, there was our banner, above the front page and flying the logo and the name. As I read what was there, a tedious description of our company, I thought of what I had thought we would be, and I decided to replace one with the other. 

It should be noted that at this point, I could not make any written word come out the way I intended it. 

I would sit at a keyboard with thoughts and intentions, but the process in me meant to packetize them into prose instead transmitted an encoded stream of cryptic poetry. I knew I was not in the best shape to be writing a statement of corporate purpose, but I felt compelled to try anyway. I couldn’t see it coming out worse than what was there. 

There are many strategies used to publicize a company, and being boring was ours. That had to change.

I do not remember exactly how the wording I came up with went. I know there were references to drugs and violence.  

The one that drew the most fire was related to sex.  It became the tipping point, but I am sure there were several other bits that would have become the focus of outrage if the line referring to latent homosexuality had not been there. I didn’t mean for it to be a derogatory line, and I do not remember it as one, either.

Later I was told that I was not being accused of homophobia. 

The reality was simply that no one wants a corporate byline to be written by a gonzo journalist. I thought that sex, drugs, and rock and roll all needed to be mentioned and lacked the presence of mind to realize that the last would imply the first two. In short, I was mad, and so was what I wrote.

It might have been something minor, except that I accompanied the change with a different password so that no one could change it back. The frantic phone calls orbited me for about an hour before someone had the nerve to call me. This had to be handled with exceptional delicacy. 

My two other partners knew I was mad; I had talked with one of them often, and at length, the whole time I had been away. 

I was still calling Brad with brilliant new ideas that would not seem brilliant to him and were not, in hindsight, brilliant at all. He even got a few versions of the stories that were all around me.

Yes, Brad heard the dirt and did not judge me for it but did realize that what I was doing reflected poorly on what we had done, who we represented, and also him. So when Brad called me, I already knew it was about the description, though I was so off that I figured accolades were about to fall my way. 

Instead, I was asked, curtly, what the password was to the site. 

I knew then that he wanted to change what I had done but still did not hesitate to give him the new code. I trusted him to make the right changes. My problem was that I trusted myself to make the right changes in the first place. My better judgment was not to trust my better judgment.

Brad hurried me off the phone, and I heard nothing further until Devin called. 

He had been quite taken with what I had written. He told me so as he asked what had happened to the new writing, that it was not there, that there was just a single inane sentence about guitars. I knew that changes might be made, but I had no idea I would be censored altogether. 

These days I would have done the same thing were I victim to another business partner’s embarrassing ramblings. Then, however, in an already agitated and paranoid state, people doing things that bothered me behind my back fed my madness, and that madness broke open.

Of course, I called Steve. 

I knew who had sold me out. He was our prize artist at the label, and our timidity was, at times, the result of his demands. 

Steve wanted his label to stay out of the way of its artists, not to draw more attention to itself than he was getting for his work. I, of course, mocked this sentiment, at least behind his back, because I correctly believed that more attention to the label would mean more attention to him and because I foolishly thought that whatever got that attention was worth any embarrassment. 

It took seconds for Steve to backpedal into a defense about what he had done. 

After words were exchanged about how I mentioned the concept of latent homosexuality in an implicitly derogatory manner, he finally broke down and said, “Honestly, Mason, I just thought it sounded crazy, and so did everyone else.” 

It was a reasonable comment considering the nature of the prose poem I had put up, but I took it as a declaration of war.

The fury of anyone is outdone by the fury of a psychotic. 

I got off the phone with Steve, letting him believe I was angry but only annoyed, and plotted digital revenge. At the time, there was an understanding between us that everything was shared as far as secrets and also that those secrets were kept in confidence. 

I had everything I needed to embarrass him horribly, and now I had reason to do so. It was at this moment that all the jokes I had told about killing Steve coalesced into a pure rage, all while the comments I had made against him to so many other people hardened perception among our circle that I really might kill him.

Steve was, at all times, almost as paranoid as I am when I get sick. 

All these words and feelings and suspicions came back at him the next morning when I got out for long enough to write what I did. Just as the description of the company came out twisted, so did my indictment of him. 

In the latter case, however, the warped nature of the prose only added to the intimidation of the piece. 

There was in it both death threats from the devil and the good guys trying to talk him down, a divine discussion about the best way to deal with someone as disgusting as Steve was. His new love after his marriage and his old love, one that quite recently failed, were detailed in bits I let out that others may or may not have picked up on, but Steve got the point – I knew I could tell more. 

The only line I remember from the whole explosion of poetic threats was from the second and last day of the posts: me saying, “Call me after your next divorce. I’ll talk to you soon.”

The final insult was a song that I had recorded a year earlier ridiculing all his friends, giving out specific details that had made me shelve the tune out of a better nature that had gotten far worse. So on top of all I wrote, some insipid, mocking tune played from the page that had brought him shame and sadness, perhaps, at my state.

The whole undertaking did my image far more damage than it did his. 

I came off as a vindictive, petty buffoon, and he got to be the victim and the better man in his circle of already self-congratulating folkies. They got to pat each other on the butt for another boring strum story, and now Steve got their pats for dealing so well with a crippled friend. 

So, even in my deluded state where I thought that hurting him badly would help me greatly, I knew that something had been broken which could not be fixed.

I watched some hints at snow come into floodlights out my window and thought that I would never know justice, not realizing that justice had nothing to do with my wounded ego. The heart shudders at such times, beating again only by its own charge. I was pulsing with a vengeance, but I was locked down for the night and would have to wait for the morning to get my next blow in. 

I thought of Steve’s words: “I just want my friend back.” 

I wondered if the snow would keep past the morning. When it did come, I ended up wiping away everything I had posted. 

In the following weeks, I saw my hits on my page drop to a tenth of what they had been. I had turned off ninety percent of my following and only to the end that I got to seem dangerous to someone else while wounding only myself. 

I sometimes wonder if a heart knows anything in its nerves, even if only that it will not beat much longer.

## Chapter 10

I found solace from my failure in Alcoholics Anonymous. 

The downtown club, Water Town, had a reputation for dealing with low-bottom drunks – the homeless and the jobless and the ones many would find worthless altogether. People sold prescription drugs out of the place, and if anyone forgot to lock it, at least one person would be sleeping there when the place was opened in the morning.

Across town, however, deep in the suburbs, in what looked like a church to any passerby was another meeting place for alcoholics, the Alano Club. 

There, people were not expected to have completely destroyed their lives to need to get sober. It was far too deep into a dull, comfortable area for anyone from the poor parts of town to walk to it, and members rarely gave rides to anyone who was. 

The best way to sum up the difference between the two meeting places was an old saying that had stuck for decades: Water Town was the House of Commons; the Alano Club was the House of Lords.

Early in my sobriety and to a considerable extent, when I was homeless in Spinks, I felt more at home among the supposed Lords. 

They had always seemed relatively common to me, with my delusions of superiority perpetuated by my mother as well as those who had praised my talents effusively over the years. 

Here were workers who toiled in shops but managed to make enough to keep up with a mortgage in our part of town; here were high school and college dropouts who tried to talk like post-doctoral professors; here were the bikers of an anti-drug gang who were rumored to attack active drunks for fun; here were people who spread rumors about all the other kinds of people and made them all sound worse in the process. 

With folks this downtrodden, it was hard for me to believe that there could be a lower class of drunks.

The fact that by my time in Spinks, I felt more at home at Water Town was remarkable. 

After all, the first few times I had gone, years before I got very sick, the trash in the place stunk. No one seemed to be coherent except for the old men who had been there since it was much sturdier in its support of the ill. Whichever meeting I went to seemed stocked with the kind of people I thought only existed in movies about the hopeless. Their plights were melodramatic, every last one. 

People argued on the verge of violence, and I knew violence was almost common there. 

Yet despite all this, I felt far less harshness from the members for my frequent incoherence and the radical swings in my mood even within the short time that I was sharing. That is one aspect to those who are judged to be the lowest of the low: they seemed, at least at that club, far less likely to consider someone like me less than some standard for functioning. 

I had changed a great deal from the twisted brat who first walked into AA at eighteen and kept walking in and out for years afterward. 

I had been kicked to the curb and kicked in the teeth when I was already down, and the pain had brought me humility at last. In this new way, I agreed with the curt old-timers and the stupid newcomers far more often than the snobs who walked in after I had lost all.

Before my explosion, I had been one who chaired meetings frequently. 

Though I had relapsed in May of 2007, only a few months before my problems got severe, the five years I had been sober and the several people who I had sponsored left me in higher regard than I might have otherwise been. 

Also, I had been around the Alano Club for nine years at that time, and I knew the old-timers better than some people who had been sober for years. 

I am told it is very rare for anyone to stay in AA after long term sobriety and then a relapse. It is even less common for someone to come back after only a short period of drunkenness. I had gone out for seven days after five years clean and was still going to meetings as often as I could. I was rare and getting rarer with each day. 

I could not see this rarity at the time, though. I only saw how sick I had become and knew how much help I needed.

Though I liked Water Town more, I had deep emotional attachments to several people among the Lords and continued these relationships in spite of my newfound distaste for the judgmentalism of the people I used to judge. 

And so, after calling a few of my old friends to arrange rides out to the suburbs, I returned to the Alano Club with a newfound intensity and began to prove doubters wrong. At least I told myself that that was my goal when hostility of every kind was driving me. 

I chaired meetings and called difficult topics, such as religion and AA, or cutting ties with unhealthy family members, and of course, medication and how it differed from drug abuse. 

For the most part, these meetings seemed appreciated and were regarded as coarse but powerful. I was contributing to the group even by calling into question core principles. I resented much about the program because, in a way, it had failed me. These meetings were easing those resentments.

Then my controversial explorations caught up with me. 

I had called evil versus the disease and argued for personal responsibility for all behavior. In so doing, I had started the meeting with the example of my violent psychosis. In other meetings that were more familiar with my issues, discussing how voices told me to kill people had been accepted and even understood by a few in the room. 

Unfortunately, the meeting I chaired with the dark topic was not so understanding. I could not know as much when my old friend Craig dropped me off at Spinks. I felt after that discussion a weight lifted off me and felt almost happy as we chatted and then said our goodbyes. 

People had accepted the worst of me, and that felt healing. 

The next day, however, I was called into a room for what I thought was going to be therapy but found a stranger in the room. Dorothy was there, too, and looking worried. I almost took comfort in her concern and could tell that whatever was causing it, she would help me go through. 

Even so, her concerned expression told me that I was in trouble, as well as letting me know that she cared that I was.

The stiff man had hair that was cut close and combed even though it was too short to need to be. Everything he wore looked tighter than comfortable as if he had gained weight and his wardrobe had not caught up with his new size. Still, he was not fat. Perhaps he had just been building muscle. His head seemed to be stuck in the air as if he were wearing an invisible neck brace. I knew already that he was some kind of authority figure. 

It is strange how details stick in intense times.

He shuffled his hands and then reached into a pocket. From it, he produced a badge and slid it across the table as if he were on a cop show. There was a smug twist to this policeman’s lips and nothing on his person that wasn’t conservative, from his white shirt to his dull tie.

“Do you know why I’m here?” he asked.

“I am going to say nothing after this sentence until I’m with a lawyer.” 

I had decided to play along with this badge slider’s scene from a cop show.

“You are being accused of nothing,” he said.

I did not speak. I did not even shrug. I just waited there for a few minutes to let my father-in-law settle into the notion that nothing was coming out of me.

“You regularly attend AA meetings?”

Still nothing from me, yet when I heard that, I knew it had something to do with someone who had not understood my problems at all. 

There is, of course, a duty to warn if a therapist believes someone might harm someone else. Apparently, that concern had brought this cop to me, and now he was leaning on me.

That may sound reasonable, unless one considers two aspects to the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. 

The first is pretty obvious. Half of the name of that organization could tell anyone why. What is said in meetings is always supposed to stay there, at least according to the traditions that guide groups. 

Some might argue that violent words were not protected by this clause, but that brings up the second point. 

In groups, it is not uncommon for people to threaten to hurt or kill those who bother them. Venting, whether or not it works, is a crucial part of what AA offers a suffering alcoholic. All of which led me to a disturbing conclusion: that what I had said had been frightening enough for someone to go beyond a usual response and bring the police into the situation even though it was against everything they believed in. 

Now, this guy was around, and I was angry at the whole program. I tried to hold it in, but I am sure he could see it.

“You have a big mouth, don’t you?’

I said nothing.

“I have been investigating violent crimes since you were a baby or maybe less than that. I can tell just by looking at you that you wouldn’t ever hurt someone that way. Just a feeling. I just want you to remember that there are consequences from what you say.”

He stood, reached across the table, took his badge, and I broke my silence.

“You get this a lot?” I asked. “I mean, people reporting what is said in meetings if it sounds nasty enough?”

“Never,” he said. “First time since I’ve been on the force.”

He all but marched out, and Dorothy escorted me back to the main room. 

As betrayed as I felt when AA did not work, I felt more betrayed, not just by principles that seemed to have failed me, but also by people who could not even practice them while assuring me that they did work after all. 

For the rest of the day, I paced and wrung my hands and thought about taking up smoking again and swore I would not drink and vowed never to go to a meeting again. But the evening came, and all I could think was that I needed somewhere safe to vent, so I went to another meeting, angrier than I had been since the walls around me were padded. Just like all the best meetings, though, I found those who understood because they had been likewise betrayed. 

After that understanding, I turned inward and looked for what made me so disturbing, anger driving me to overcome anger itself, and all the while, I was afraid.

## Chapter 11

I had a blast parading around in the new suit I had purchased. 

I used it for an amateur photoshoot where Devin took pictures of me that I would use for websites. But it was not only me in those pictures – I got Devin’s sister Allison in on them. She wore the First Lady-like coat I had bought her along with some fantastic black leggings. 

Of course, it helped that anything would look great on a girl like that. 

She was a girl, too, just a few months past eighteen. Her boyfriend was only a year or two younger than me, however, so though I had nine years on her, I felt I was a viable option. As such, I had gotten her number and was texting back forth with her every day since she had received the jacket. 

Allison was at heart a loving being, like Devin, who cared about me in a sort of sisterly way. She was not ready, however, for the ardent ardor. I was to push her way. 

No one could have been, but she, like Terri, did not take much of it before pulling away from me.

Still, I will always have the day of the pictures when Devin photographed the two of us together. I had the idea of not only having us both in shots but of taking one where I would be stroking her hair. Today I look at these shots and see an apparent fear that I mistook for pleasure when viewing the photographs later that day.

Allison said nothing about how uncomfortable I may or may not have made her. 

The fact was that she had a man and was also beholden to me because of how close our families were. Devin had been like a brother to me since twelve or so and had brought his sister to me so that she could sing on a few of my tracks with a sense of comfort that I could not fall for her. Of course I did, though I did have the common sense to hang back until she was out of high school to act. 

This was the cluster of consequences that led to some of my worst weeks in Spinks: my lust and avarice and my parent’s wrath. 

They found out about my spending, and shouting followed, one side attacking the other while my parents felt put into the unfair position of giving me a pass because of how mad I was. 

I, for my part, accepted full personal responsibility for the debt I accrued and assured them that I and only I would be the one who paid it back. My parents did not believe this would happen, were sure I had just spent more of their money, and then written off my personal responsibility by claiming it proved that I was sick and needed sympathy rather than discipline. 

I was learning, though, through neglect, and helpful neglect at that, how I had to bear the consequences of my own behavior. 

For my part, when I had to pay up, I redirected all the contact information from the last card to my own phone and an old address of mine to insulate them from harassment by my creditors. I then defaulted on that card, sent it into collections, and never looked back. 

This was not enough to stay my parent’s rage. 

They exploded, and I exploded, and there were death threats and tears, and I went back to my room in Spinks and paced around, sure that I was in the right and wanting to punish my parents for how inconsiderate they were being about my symptoms. 

So, I called my therapists and revoked all my releases of information and dodged all calls from family members, leaving my parents altogether cut off from any updates on my status just as I had become violently psychotic again. 

I was also, for the first time in my stay, alone, utterly so, and there was nothing I could do that would take away the sting of another betrayal. 

My father showed some signs of forgetting and forgiving, but my mother, who kept the books around the house, had been scorned. There was no chance for recovering from this horrible mistake except to blame myself entirely and wait for time to turn the wounds into yet another scar I had left on her. 

Without any family, all I had was Devin and a few friends from AA for support. 

This left me in better shape than most of the folks in Spinks, but the love level I was feeling was lower, if only from how high it had once been. 

I felt alienated from everything, in the way of a man who wants the solace of a woman, even if it is only her words.

So I went to the nurse I had met in the Unit, and she helped a bit, but I found no excitement there, instead looking at her as being as sick as I was for interacting with a former patient the way she was with me. Allison, though, I did not hold to such professional standards, and I turned to her when it seemed that nothing else would connect me to my senses. 

I was falling away again and reaching out to an eighteen-year-old girl for my rescue, but she could not hold me. I was a man; I was a heavy man, and my hand slipped ever further down her soft palm, then to the fingers, as I hung with only her grasp.

The connection with Allison broke after I sent her a snotty text message. 

I scolded her once for not getting back to me sooner than she had, which was absurd, as it had only taken a few hours. In those hours, she was gone, and I could barely think of anything but this absence, and when she finally wrote me back, I told her she was full of herself. 

Our friendship, one I wished was a relationship, perhaps out of my own pathology, ended. The last woman fell away, and Devin was annoyed, and at last, I was left with only a Gideon Bible for solace. 

So I took up smoking again, smoking as if it would drive out some psychological bees from the hive of my neurons. 

A fellow just out of jail took me for a pair of headphones and a whole canister of instant coffee for about a pack’s worth of cigarettes hand-rolled poorly and I wondered where I would get the money to punish my heart and each of theirs. 

That was of less concern, though, than the knowledge that I was driving my parents further back with no company to keep me from the crushing reality of the consequences that slept with me each night I was bound to that shelter. There I would stand, in the fall snow, shivering and twitching and lighting a loose smoke three times to get it going. 

I was dying more quickly again.

## Chapter 12

There is nothing so depressing as a holiday alone except perhaps for a holiday almost alone. The latter would be how I would spend my holiday.

Chuck was around because he was broke, and together we worked out a way to drive the two hours or so to Lansing and see my grandmother before she was lost. 

I knew that, if she did remember me at all, it would be the last time she would. 

So I rode with Chuck down interstate ninety-six and passed car after car during our afternoon burn to the capitol. By the time we got there, however, the family had already eaten their Thanksgiving dinner, so all Chuck and I got was company. 

My grandmother was thin as she had been in the first years of her marriage to my grandfather, but her body was gone, and her mind was almost gone as well. 

We were told she had Lewy Body Dementia, which, unlike other forms of dementia that crush memories and leave the brain a pulp, made her entire body more rigid with each passing day. 

Chuck and I met my maternal grandfather at his home, walking right into the strange, flat, square mansion, past the parlor and the dining room, and the changing room whose window showed the indoor pool as the TV room flashed us toward it like a lighthouse. 

We made it in and greeted Grandpa Jack, or Dampa in our childhood, with handshakes only, and then he was back in his recliner watching the weather channel in glorious high definition. 

Grandpa Jack liked to know the conditions for flight several times a day as if he would have to rent his family a two prop and fly us to some refuge at any given instant. 

When he was not watching it on the tube, he was on his flight simulator, at least during his free time. Until Grandma had been put into a nursing home the same exact day that I had exploded, he had had almost no free time, but that had changed, if only at an enormous price. To pay for this, he stripped his wife of all her assets, declared her independent, and filed for Medicare to cover his plan. 

When the powers that be denied him, he used his assets to hire an influential lawyer who made a case for my grandmother’s poverty and need. 

As wealthy as Jack and Bethany seemed, everything that was worth something for them was either a physical object or a home. My grandfather had blown their fortune by the late Seventies and had to take a consulting job in Tokyo that came just as he was looking down the cliff of bankruptcy. 

Then, as is so often the case for my family members and me, breaks came our way, and we found means to the ends we wanted. 

My grandpa’s fight to nurse his wife came because he would have lost everything he had if he would have had to keep her in any nursing home, and when he did win the case, it felt right, not as though he cheated, but instead as though he had saved the entire family through cunning. 

In a way, he had.

Bethany still got out to visit her home, to see her dog Peggy Two, a springer spaniel much like other springer spaniels – epileptic upon introduction. The dog would often have to be restrained, lest it knock her down and shatter something or everything that was left in her.

When Chuck and I got there late in the Thanksgiving afternoon, Grandpa had already brought her home from her new home, and she sat beside him in the recliner that was always hers. I will never forget that the conversations we had were mutually intelligible. This was a feat considering her state and my state. 

Still, it was evident at least to me that my madness had made me uniquely able to comprehend hers. 

After all, by that point, I had had hundreds of conversations with older people who were dealing with dementia rather than mental illness. I could speak their language. 

So, Dama Bethany went on about how I needed to straighten out my act and stop threatening family members. I was told that I would never heal unless I fought with myself instead. 

The whole time I had been speaking to my grandmother, I had been fingering a rosary. 

One of my followers from the Behavioral Health Unit had given me the sterling silver beads, a family heirloom, just before he was released. He said I would need them to battle evil. The beads felt very old and significantly valuable. I had convinced the owner of my divinity, or at least he said I had, and blessed me with the gift in response. 

Looking back, he may have given me the rosary because he thought I needed a great deal of God’s help to heal. Since he had given it to me, I had carried the rosary everywhere and squeezed it as a sort of stress ball. It was with me as I went through the stress of seeing the loved one before me.

Then something remarkable happened. 

Dama Bethany broke from her near-paralysis and reached out a hand, seeming to ask to hold the rosary. 

I handed it to her, and she began to finger it as I had been doing. Even though her eyes seemed locked in place by her disease, she still managed to smile a bit at me. Then Chuck came in to spend some time with her. As soon as he saw the cross, everything got dicey. He mocked me softly, and the voices to murder him rose for the umpteenth time. 

After that, he snatched away the rosary and forced it into my palm. 

The voices got louder, my tongue slipping them into whispers aloud. I prayed, and somehow I was given my daily bread. I had the strength and nourishment to face a struggle as difficult as mine had become. 

I put the rosary back in my pocket and told my grandmother that I loved her.

She said, “I love you too.” That is the last time she ever told me anything along those lines, anything affectionate. Her collapse settled her into the sand of a sculpture of a sphinx; she was impossible to understand unless one considered her words to be a sort of outsider poetry, free verse that always felt like clues to an important but opaque riddle. 

There would be no solution. 

Chuck and Grandma exchanged kind words, and then it was time for the road back to Roosevelt, where my parents were not, where their house was empty except for Chuck, and where there had been a party the night before. 

As he drove too fast but quite smoothly, I read something I had found at my other grandmother’s home – my father’s signed copy of The Book of Common Prayer. I opened it and found counsel on how to fight a war in Christ’s name. 

Crusades had always seemed to contradict themselves – there could be no mission to win the land of milk and honey by force without violence. 

But the longer I had been in the hospital setting, the more I felt as though the promised land would only come through force. Above all this were my ruminations on Christ’s attack of the money lenders, those peddlers of spiritual merchandise, and the charge in Psalms to fight holy battles that were more than just a metaphor. 

Now that God had come back as me, he was on Earth for the vengeance that was his. 

It was in this violent, religious reverie that I batted back the orders of the Dark Lord. He wanted Chuck killed. He wanted death, but more than that, he wanted chaos. He let me live on as the Lord because my futile attempts to be God were causing the chaos he loves most. 

The Dark Lord was ruling as he ever did, like a vacuum that sucked madness into its power. He and only he is why we stay lost, and walking on is attacking him. 

I will never surrender to evil, and there was evil, I was about to find out, beyond anything I could have seen or imagined, and it was coming to sleep in my room. Those last nights of peace with a laid back roommate, I ate only what I ate on Thanksgiving. 

My supper was microwave popcorn and instant oatmeal and holy spite. 

## Chapter 13

Lester had only two visible teeth and a slack jaw beneath them. Bald as someone in cancer treatment, he looked as though all his hair was absolutely gone -- not shaved, gone. He wore the same clothes every day, inside and out – a red and blue parka, jeans, cowboy boots. Around his neck or over his ears, he had a cheap pair of headphones attached to a tiny portable radio. I could hear country music pumping out of him every time he walked by. When he spoke, it sounded as if he were a cartoon character of a country boy, like a bad actor’s interpretation. 

None of this was particularly disturbing. 

Many stranger-looking people had come in and out of Spinks. Lester’s behavior, however, was exceptionally fucked up. The first thing he told me about himself was that he had been released six months before from twenty-nine years in prison. He had been seventeen when the sentence was handed down, so he was now forty-six. 

I did the math on his imprisonment and quickly realized that, with a stay that long, murder was probably his conviction. 

I like to think that I am an exceptionally tolerant man. My first thought after realizing what he had done was that even men who have killed deserve a chance to get better. Any sympathy I had, however, became terror only seconds after I learned those two facts about him. 

While talking to me, he began to look to my left and spoke a one-way conversation with someone who was both imaginary and clearly interacting with him. 

Then it got worse. 

Lester introduced me to his father. Then he began to say, over and over, “You know.” Each time, the word “know” came with even more emphasis on the second word. 

Finally: “You know I killed him just like you did.” 

This was a strange moment, to say the least. 

After all, it had been murderous voices that had gotten me into the hospital in the first place, voices that wanted me to kill my father. Perhaps Lester regularly accused people of committing the same crime he had, but this accusation threw me off. I was still off enough to believe that the madman somehow had seen the hate in me and tried to bond with me over that. 

“You know,” was most of what he said, but even that began to scare me.

There was what he said, and then there was what he did. 

Lester had some obsession with the shower. He would stay in the bathroom all night, bellowing or screaming over and over for entire nights. It sounded as though a demon like the one I knew had him. In fact, I began to believe that the devil had sent Lester to destroy my mind or me or both.

The shower and the hollering was not the only way he got in my head. 

Someone had given the man instant coffee, and he spent hours mixing it with the water from the shower and drawing strange shapes on the walls. None of them were letters, though they looked like their own alphabet with all new characters. I wondered if Lester could, in his own way, read them.

This went on for about a week before I reported him to the staff. 

The reporting was not so much out of masochism as out of the naïve assumption that this staff would figure out what was going on and help me out. In the meantime, I slept at most an hour a night but was otherwise driven so hard by a fight or flight pressure that drifting off was impossible. 

The staff would not let me sleep on a couch in the lounge as this was against Spinks policy for a reason no one could explain. 

There is nothing that will make a crazy person go crazier than sleep deprivation will. So by early December, I was the kind of disaster who has been knocked down by a mad man and is about to knock down someone else. 

I was domino falling, yet again, on my dad. I would pick at him, and somehow his tolerance would take the day. 

I think it helped that I told him just how nasty my living situation was at that time. He was only really sympathetic of my mess-ups when I could blame them on pathology. This was the kind of incentive to stay unwell that Joyce had been going on about months before. Lester was keeping me sick, regardless.

Ultimately, when Lester was sent to a more secure and intense facility, it wasn’t because any mental health professionals on staff had noticed his problems. It was because the cute little cleaning girl opened the door to the bathroom that had been mine and found Lester’s temple of madness instead. 

Between the stains and the water, she had a huge job ahead of her, and she was smart enough to realize that it would be like this again, as long as Lester was living in such a lax place.

Over little things, the staff’s unwillingness to intercede into client behavior at Spinks felt like fresh liberty after the Unit, but when security became an issue, I wanted them to crack down on every aberrance in the place.

It was around Lester that I developed an idea that was ultimately to help me more than almost anything that I had come up with at that point. 

I brought it to my therapist. I sat in Dorothy’s office, a basement affair in the shoddy ground floor of a split level that housed the organization responsible for the city’s most intractable lunatics. 

The door was shut, and I wondered if she were willing to shut it with clients who had a much more substantial history of violence than I did. 

I thought about the way I was coddled by my treatment team often. I am not sure whether it was my adherence to their suggestions or if it was my abstinence from alcohol and all street drugs that earned me such treatment. Regardless, I got it. I was about to really get a break, and it was all due to my theory.

“You don’t get sane by hanging out with other insane people. You get sane by hanging out with sane people.” 

I then asked for fourteen hours out of Spinks each day. The most that had ever been given up to that point, I was told, was five hours. 

Dorothy did not hesitate. 

She agreed and said that the only way it would not happen would be if the director of the program allowed it. “In your case,” she said, “I think that’s going to happen.”

Lester was taken away, and my world opened a great deal. 

My life was, in a slight but significant way, getting better. I had from seven am to nine pm to do whatever I chose with my day. 

There was a catch, however. 

I was strongly encouraged to stay out once I had gotten out. This ended up synchronizing my schedule with the denizens of the overnight homeless shelter, who were kicked out all day and had to find places to congregate for warmth. Hence the hobo conventions in the public library. 

The Dover Public Library was something like an oversized Victorian mansion made entirely out of stone. Under the colored light through its wide stained glass windows under paintings of millionaires from the lumber boom, the crushed gathered to put themselves back together. 

I kept my distance from them. 

By that point, I was carrying my laptop with me constantly, and I did not want to be mugged by some fellow human disaster. My life had gotten bad enough without having to deal with getting robbed. 

When outside the hospital, I would dress in several layers, sometimes wearing two hooded sweatshirts at once. 

A miserably cold winter was already setting in by early December, and such precautions made life much more comfortable. Because I was something of a clothes horse, with a vast wardrobe that was almost entirely in Spinks by that point, I made a strange look for myself. I joked that I was the best dressed homeless man in Roosevelt at AA meetings. This was not far from the truth.

My time out secured, all that remained was a way to find some sane people, a task that was perhaps easier than one might expect. 

I went for those who had been sober for a considerable period, had worked through AA, and were able to both understand and guide me toward a life more centered. 

I immersed myself in AA, going to several meetings a day, organizing meetings, and working the steps hard, an incredibly therapeutic process. One of the claims made by twelve-step programs is that sanity will return if the work is done. That is why I looked to those with quality time in the program to help me.

It was through a fusion of AA and mental health concepts that I came up with the most therapeutic act of all. There are instructions in AA on how best to pray. One is supposed to pray twice daily for sobriety, among other things. I added sanity to this prayer and stuck to it. 

As soon as I sought sanity, my mind began to change for the better at last.

## Chapter 14

In December, my brother Chuck moved into Brad’s manor. 

The place was less than a mile from Spinks, close enough that I could walk there without bother. The familiarity of a place where I used to live comforted me even though the time I had spent there was strange and, at times, horrible. By that point, I enjoyed any part of my life that did not remind me of my time in the hospital. During the hours I was out, I wanted to pretend as if I were living my old life. 

By that point, the only issue that kept me from leaving Spinks was money. I had none.

My parents had used the eight hundred dollars in my bank account to pay for the expenses of my madness – getting the car out of impound, fixing my computer, and who knows what else. This was typical of them. When I had recieved my grants for graduate school, they kept the money, leaving me with debt I could not afford. I was in even worse shape than when I had left New York, and money was my only way to freedom.

To solve this problem, I decided to throw a party at my brother’s house and take donations. 

So I invited hundreds of people over the internet to come party at my brother’s house. The buzz kept building from there. Within days, dozens of people were confirmed guests. Many of them I had never heard of and would likely never hear from again. The invite made the price of admission clear. This implied that people were ready to pay. For the first time in months, I felt hopeful that I could raise enough to afford my own place. 

Unfortunately, I had not asked for permission from Chuck or Brad to throw this party, and this angered them. I had brazenly taken advantage of what they had for my own selfish gain. I had brought together The Concert for Mason Dennis.

I had been told by both men who kept up the place that I was not to book any bands. So it became a concert in name only, and I was allowed only one aspect I wanted for the occasion: the party was going to feature a continuous jam session. 

This Brad and Chuck found more agreeable, perhaps because they had to pay no one for entertainment, or perhaps for other reasons that I could not comprehend.

I invited the nurse from the Unit, but she said her plans conflicted with the evening. I also invited a couple of sisters who used to party with me when I lived at the house downtown. Then there were other women – Devin’s new squeeze and several of his old ones looked to be in attendance. Most of its attendees no longer even lived in Roosevelt. 

The date was set so that many, many people would be in town, December 23rd, ideally positioned for such guests. 

Also, I was able to secure a three day leave for Christmas. It was also set up that I was to stay at the Manor to avoid conflict with my parents. So I would be around for the whole night of revelry. 

Everything was in place for a wonderful evening. Life seemed to be opening to me at last. 

I was smoking in the basement, waiting for something I could not place when the world changed a bit, if only within my perception of it. I saw a woman and knew that she was the event for whom I had been waiting. The rest of the party seemed to slow to a stop as if life were an action movie, and I was dodging a bullet. 

Perhaps Cupid had upgraded his equipment. 

She was Pamela, a young woman who’d partied at that house with us months before. 

Accompanied by her sister, Pamela effused enthusiasm for the work I had up on my website – drawings, songs, stories – she loved it all. 

Like most of my acquaintances, she had heard about my plight. Between my best high school friend telling everyone at my ten-year high school reunion that I was irrevocably insane, at my request, and the party invitation that announced my plight in an attempt to increase attendance out of pity,  everyone in Roosevelt seemed to know about my collapse. 

I had publicized the breakdown to the chagrin of both family and friends. 

To me, the severity of it had become a sick joke. Also, widespread knowledge meant widespread attention, and I was at that time convinced that the more attention I attracted to myself, the more attention I would attract to my art, and the better my career would go. My histrionics had drawn Pamela’s attention my way, and that night of the party, she made my parade of madness feel worthwhile.

At one point, I walked by the nurse who had so bewitched me in the hospital, and she called at me to come to her, but I looked at Pamela, who looked so much better that I could not bring myself to part from her side even for a moment. 

Hearing the echoes of all our calls, all her support fell silent. I had a new interest who looked better, and that was enough to keep me away.

I invited her and the friends who were with her up to my room. 

There we listened to music on my computer and discussed singing. Pamela claimed that she was a natural, and we agreed to make a go of playing together. The rest of the night, I spent showing her various creations I had made during my hours in the hospital. She seemed to love them all. 

In the middle of it all, I asked if she was seeing anyone, and she answered, “Sort of.” There was a man with whom she was spending a great deal of time but had yet to kiss. 

I told her that I would not be able to be friends with her, that I had other intentions that, if foiled, would end our acquaintance. 

She complained that such an ardor for her was so typical as to annoy her. 

The dissonance did not last, and when our harmony resumed, it seemed more pleasing than ever. The night ended with an exchange of numbers and a long hug. When I faded into sleep hours later, I thought only of her as the randomness closed around my thoughts, scattering them into dreams.

The next night, Christmas Eve, I had gone through the motions with the family, pretending that I did not hear threats to them all pounding through my head every hour or so. 

I made it, though, and felt a sense of peace as I found myself back at the house. I had been there less than an hour when Pamela called. 

She wanted to see me, she wanted to know if I were at the Manor, and she wanted to play music together. As it happened, Pamela was in a warehouse that had been made into studio apartments, a building only a short block away.  

When I learned that she was this near, I told her to come right away, and she did.

No sooner had I opened the door for her than I offered her a beer. 

She took it, and we headed into the practice room in the basement of the Manor. 

I sat at the keyboard and tried to get her to match a melody for one of my songs written for a woman to sing. There was a lovely uniqueness to her voice, but she was having a hard time keeping up with the scattering of high and low notes, a melody that bounced through arpeggios and offered little space for expression. 

After a few minutes, it was clear that I would have to write material specifically for her. So we began to draft something.

I started simple, with a gentle two-chord pattern. Pamela took to the music right away. After only a minute, we had a melody down, and two minutes later, I cranked out the first draft of lyrics. Finally, I worked out a vocal melody, and we had a song. We played it once through, and that first time it rang through my heart like a blood clot, knocking me into a stupor. The chemistry was intense and joyous, and in its loveliness, I felt a love for me growing in her.

I walked her back to the apartment building where her ride was waiting. 

She asked me up to the loft where her friend remained, but I declined, saying that I needed to take meds and sleep if I were to make it through Christmas Day without murdering anyone. 

When she laughed, I laughed, and such acts suddenly felt absurd and impossible for someone like myself. I was softening even with the slightest contact with a sane woman. 

The night was painfully frigid, and I wanted to draw her body near mine if only for practical reasons, but I could not summon the courage to do so. 

Then came a moment like so many others in the course of my romantic journey, a crossroads I barely sensed, an instant where our paths may have intertwined rather than paralleled each other, and I could feel it then, the pulse of luck that had won me a fortune, but the fortune was not enough, and I had to bet it all away, being the fool that I was, being the kind who believes the house of love can be beat, and it was time to bet. 

All of which is to say that she wanted to kiss me goodnight. 

In her stuttered parting words, I felt romance present in every way, and yet I could not take it, I would not take it, even as I should have. I did not even hug her. I just gave her a high-five and slipped back into arctic waters of the Michigan air in winter. 

Schizophrenia is more often too cold than too passionate, and my medications had perhaps cooled the romance from me altogether.

## Chapter 15

Every year on the night of Christmas, a group of my old friends throws a party. 

More than anything, the event seems to be about having a place to make sure there are drinks around on a day when alcohol is not sold. The night meant getting drunk. That year it was decided to have the party at the Manor. For me, there was no escaping the mayhem. I only could ride the night and hope I did not crash on the shore in my metaphor.

Brad hosted the evening. 

As such, what he brought to the night could have kept all those in the place drunk for a solid week. Thanks to him, there was a well-stocked bar. That was far from all there was to drink, however. Chuck had secured a few cases of beer, but the majority of the available alcohol came in along with each guest. Everyone seemed to bring at least a twelve pack. It would be the rare Manor party where there was still booze left the next morning. 

In the meantime, I drew the only sober breaths in the place. 

Still, the environment had a destabilizing effect on me. Between the chatter and the shouts, I could not find peace in which I could rest. Every floor held people tromping around, bringing the party to every nook in the place. There would be no sleep for me in spite of my medication. I took those pills, and even they could not lower my energy to a pleasant level. The revelry was contagious, even to me, even without booze. I partied vicariously and got a contact high in so doing.

As the evening moved along into a state of even more heightened excitation, the time for the tradition came. This meant that there would be a singing contest. 

Three friends who were deemed to be unbiased were asked to judge the performances. They sat in a row just to the left of our performance space. 

Ultimately the battle came down to a contest between Ty and me. The two of us have a comparable talent and an understanding of performance, how to bring a crowd in and hold it. It would come down to whoever was on that night, and I was as yet unsure if I would be the one to take it. 

Still, I walked up to Ty and told him that he had already lost. 

He was pretending to take it seriously – at least his enthusiasm seemed disingenuous – and he spat taunts back at me.

I sang Bohemian Rhapsody from start to finish with every word and flourish. While doing so, I first ripped out a chunk of hair and smeared it atop the bald head of one of my older friends, then left the wad there for him to brush off. As I bounced between high notes, I bided my time for the final flourish. As I wrapped up the last lines, I grabbed a cup from another judge’s hand, dumped it on my head, threw it on the ground, and stomped it. 

“See?” I asked Ty. “You already lost.”

Ty picked a song at least as complicated as the one I had chosen. He sang a Frank Zappa song, “The Illinois Enema Bandit.” As this piece was initially performed by the brilliant vocalist Ike Willis, there were dozens of trills and swoops, and Ty hit them all. The whole time he was stomping in time with his tune. 

The display was impressive, and his choice of song seemingly disarmed and amused everyone. By the time he finished, it was obvious that neither one of us was the clear winner. I had gone relatively far into the realm of performance art with my antics, but Ty’s actual singing seemed more impressive. 

The judges headed to a room in the basement and spent the next hour closed off in a room, deliberating. I had a hard time believing that it was that difficult for them to pick one of us, but for whatever reason, everyone seemed to want to get it right. 

As such, the verdict, when it came, came with an explanation. 

It was unanimous or had become so after their lengthy discussion. I won. I won, it was said because I went further than Ty did in making the performance unforgettable. There was no denying that my antics were extreme, but they spoke to an enthusiasm and a willingness for victory that Ty seemed to lack or at least lack in comparison to me. 

Extreme means carried the day.

As the night narrowed the crowd down to a small gathering, and then just Brad and me, I got a chance to really talk with my friend and partner about where our mutual creation was headed. I was still so dismayed by my conflict with Steve that I had broken off my intent to release my own work.  

Brad implored me not to do so, and there, at least while I was sitting with him, I still wanted to be a part of our company. 

So many times, the dream of Houndstooth had been bled dry in hopes that it would save us. Every time the vampires walked away satiated, and we were left to die. Ultimately, Brad and I were doomed because we expected that kindness would be returned with kindness when the music business is absolutely nothing like that. 

Really, we had gotten into the undertaking because of moments like the one we were sharing just then.

Then I was playing a song I had written during a previous time in the manor, an epic nine-minute number comparing an unhealthy relationship to a war that cannot be won. There were investments made in foolish dreams that were impossible to withdraw when it became clear that precisely such a withdrawal was needed. 

The relationship that had drawn up this comparison was never really romantic. 

Insisting that it was as much in song only furthered the delusion that it had been that kind of relationship. Terri, the one over whom I poured scorn, had been a friend only for fleeting but intense intervals. When we spent any time together, we spent all of our time together. 

So, for two separate months, about a half a year apart, we were inseparable. 

There was little more than our proximity to our intimacy. Sure, we talked about getting married and even named our children and kissed twice near the end, but we had not fucked, never once fucked, so it did not mean anything. 

At least, that is how I have come to see it.

I had no business, then, working with the Iraq War as a metaphor for my quagmire of infatuation. Perhaps there were some parallels. I was delusional when I engaged the other party, both in how easily victory would come and how poorly I took care of the time after our interactions. 

This was to say nothing of self-deception so that I could justify a second approach to a goal I could not reach the first time around. 

I even declared conquest before it had been secured and in consequence was driven off by the resistance. I could go on like this, but what point is there? 

I have withdrawn from my presence inside her borders of personal space. We will never again be inseparable. 

Yet still, I write about her. Still, I write for her to read. Still, I dream of her. 

This will never come to pass, of course. She does not return calls or messages of any kind. I have even made ultimatums to no end. The last time I heard from her was a curt email asking me to stop using her real name and one of her commonly known nicknames in works of art.

The nine-minute song detailing our bluesy entanglement came in a rush that day that I learned Terri was in a relationship with one of my better friends in the program. 

It was about four months after I had left the city, and it looked as though we would be only long-distance friends. Still, we traded declarations of love, and she stayed in my heart with Jesus and my blood. 

Then, from someone else, I learned of the new man. So instead of killing or even hurting, I buried my feelings in words, but the feelings were undead, kept clawing their way out of the deep graves where I had left them. They would not and will not die.

I explained all this to Brad as he sat attentive, wired as usual, with a chaw in his mouth and a beer cup rimmed with brown spittle. 

Between acknowledgments that he was listening, he would shoot a wad into the cup. 

After it ended, he said he wanted to record that song in a studio with everything done just so. I nodded and hoped it was not the kind of promise made by the idle wealthy to amuse themselves. 

I knew Brad was not that kind of fellow, but I also knew that any number of people could be involved in such a recording process who would be unable to carry through with offered help. 

We never again mentioned the truth as it was clearly displayed – that I would never again be the capable man with whom Brad founded Houndstooth and by whom Terri had been floored. I do not prefer who I became. 

I want the swagger I had in my delusions, whether they were that Terri loved me and that I could make just about anyone else do the same, or that I was destined for the greatness my mother had promised. 

Hours past midnight, Christmas behind us, we had only to watch the year die, and then time would just be time and not the holidays. As I spun the token for my insane performance, some piece of garbage that had been made into a meaningless reward, I thought once more of Terri and the infinite distance between us. 

There would be no someday. 

The best I could hope for was nothing further with Terri. Somehow, this time the spirit of Christ and Christmas could not redo what had been undone. God may be love and may be able to resurrect life, but I have never heard of him resurrecting love itself. 

Infatuation was an even more hopeless cause. The time had come to cut and run. 

## Chapter 16

While I was in the hospital, I had an idea that I thought would be my future. 

The undertaking began when I discovered that capehope.com was not taken. Cape Hope was the name of Devin’s warehouse, where we played and recorded music. The fact that capehope.com was still available seemed providential. 

From there, I only had to figure out what to do with the place. 

At first, I put up strange collages with links to music files or streaming video that was only tangentially related to the content. Some of my friends liked this pastiche, and some were disturbed by it. 

Regardless, it was clear that people were paying attention to me.

I should have left the page that way. Cryptic as it was, it had a certain charm to its methodical madness. The work seemed just past the edge of chaos, yet still within view of order. Really, it was beautiful. I really was doing something fairly novel with the blog format. I was putting up whole pages. 

Each day I brought out an entirely new theme. 

I had time to dump out content upon content. I even lined up interviews with a few respected artists, one a musician, the other a writer. The madness seemed to be falling together into its own sort of genius – where hallucinations become visions and visions become plans, and the result is something new to the world.

If I sound a bit too effusive for comfort in my estimation of the original version, it is because of how anemic what became of it was. 

Instead of following the edge and laughing over the abyss of inscrutability, looking down from its edge at intelligibility below, I settled for boring. I picked a single, simple theme with nothing to distinguish it from any other blog. 

If anything, it looked worse than something built from a template. 

I had made better pages than that ten years before when the technology made a design all the harder. I am not sure why I went with cowardly convention, but I did. Perhaps it was the reaction I had gotten from a few friends who were worried that the randomness could lead to another battle as it had with Steve. I did not want to be innovative because, by that point, 

I was laboring to seem sane.

While my efforts to fit in with the world were appreciated by both my treatment team and those who cared about me, they required strength on my part to resist the darkness. The Dark Lord had not left me alone. He had stopped threatening and demanding action from me, but his taunts still erupted at times of stress. 

Take the day that I had to go back to the hospital after my three-day break for Christmas.

I had been flanked on all sides by chattering family—all of my dad’s side being in town, some fifteen people. Social situations were, at that point, still a bother to me. I had to be in the right place mentally to stay in a place where people were drinking to excess. At the Concert For Mason Dennis, I had been expecting a wild night and so had been able to prepare for it, but that was not the case with what happened a few nights later. 

There was really nothing to it other than an explosion of that Devil breaking through the surface of my conscious mind and throwing himself around in my head. 

It was time to kill again, apparently. I had not heard this for a while. So after dinner but before dessert, I demanded that my father bring me back to Spinks. 

He delayed and told me not to worry. 

I do not think he had a sense of how different I was from the Mason whom he had known the Christmas before. Restraint was foreign. So I began to demand to escape obnoxiously, and at last, my mother overheard and told my father she would take me back. 

Dad eschewed this plan in favor of taking me back myself. 

Several in the crowd thought this a bad idea, as my father tended to activate my symptoms more than anyone else. I do not think he realized that I was once again suffering from the pain of resistance to incredible force, that I was growing weary from holding the door as the voices pounded on it like zombies bent on breaking in and killing. 

I could not let the force overtake me, so I tried a technique that meant lesser rather than greater harm. 

I began to scream at my dad. I chastised him for not following my demands at once. 

He was once again belittling the seriousness of my situation. He had no idea what he was dealing with. He needed to have more respect for how sick I was. He was endangering himself and our family by delaying when I insisted on leaving. 

The whole time he wore a smug smile, slight but undeniably there. 

In his eyes, there was some worry, but I felt as though I were nine again, and he was telling my mother that I was not so sick as I claimed to be, no matter what kind of sickness or even how severe it was. This illness had to build to a crisis point before Dad seemed willing to acknowledge that he could not handle the situation himself. 

He was, in short, a doctor.

When my bluster blew over, we were just about to Spinks. 

He apologized, and I left with a curt goodbye. 

I felt strangely fond of Spinks as I went back into it. This felt like home. I had become institutionalized. The structure of being back by nine and taking my medication right after and waking up at five was comforting in its regularity. 

For the first time, I felt as though I was choosing to come back not to get disability or because the court said I had to be there. I was choosing to come back because I wanted to be where it was best for me to be. 

When I got back into the place, I went to work as I did every night. 

I would pound out as much work as I could before I absolutely had to collapse from exhaustion. I am not sure what exactly it was that drove me. I was a non-profit workaholic, something like an alcoholic at the end of their disease course when there is no longer any reward for getting drunk. 

Only the avoidance of pain drove me. 

Whenever I stopped laboring for long enough to think about the course that the illness had taken or how far I was from where I had wanted to be in life, I despaired. I felt exhaustion covering me like a corpse on a stretcher. Such thoughts would not take long to take me as low as the victims who surrounded me. 

Above all, I refused to acknowledge that I was a victim myself. 

There was denial in this refusal to admit as much. My illness had destroyed me. Still, I felt that I was not disabled. If I could make sites like the one that consumed my attention at that time, if I could memorize dozens of songs if everything in my life pointed toward my abilities, how could I deny them? 

It did not occur to me that I had lost every job I had ever had to a mental health condition, with one exception, a web design job I left to go to a literary retreat. That one had only worked because I could make my own hours, sleep all day when I needed to and cram in the hours when I could. In a way, there was truth to my own estimation of my capabilities. 

After all, I was designing sites again and only needed to find a few clients to really get underway. 

So when my phone rang with a call from some cog in the Social Security machine, I did not think twice about telling the bureaucrat that I was not disabled. After all, they had asked how I could be disabled if I had managed to get a graduate degree, and my ego could not admit that that accomplishment was only possible because I was carried by my parents the whole way.

My denial was to extend my sentence. 

The process of my disability was stopped and nullified. That administration is always looking for a reason not to grant benefits – they are not nearly as easy to get as they used to be – and my insistence on my wellness was more than enough to keep me from getting help.

In the end, it did not matter whether or not I was disabled. 

It only mattered that I get money from some source other than my family to get started on my own, the only situation those treating me thought would allow me to heal. Even as the process of getting help from the government felt like a ruse, I needed it whether or not I wanted it.

 Eventually, I just started looking at the benefits as if they were a grant that would allow me to continue work on projects like my site. When that perspective shift came, I became much more open to the opportunity a basic income offered.

Then there was the possibility of back money.  Benefits meant a lump sum going back to when the mental illness first took hold. I thought I had a good shot of qualifying for the reward backdating to years prior. 

Plus, I had ambitious plans for what I would do with that: it would allow me to move, and once free of the small minds in Roosevelt, I would be able to be eccentric and not get treated like a criminal for that quality. 

Depending on how far back it was deemed that I first became disabled, I stood to make thousands of dollars. Ultimately, greed was enough for me to play along. Never did it occur to me how crazy it was to think I was not crazy. 

I was still fighting with whether or not to follow a destiny of starting a religion and refuting murderous orders from a spirit that claimed to have fathered Lucifer. 

As I knocked out amateurish constructions like my art site, I did so because coming to rest gave the monstrous forces in me time to take over. So my supposed demonstration of competence was really evidence of my madness. 

It was good that I wanted to be at Spinks because I needed to be there. 

I just could not admit that need. I just knew that if I got far enough away from my family, we would all be safer and better off, and people would realize that I had been sane all along, that the whole fall had been a misunderstanding, and that the devil and my Godly ambitions would stay in Roosevelt, where madness belonged, and I did not. 

## Chapter 17

New Year’s Eve I was not so lucky as to spend with Pamela. 

I could take no leave that night and had to celebrate it at Spinks. My parents gave me a case of soda pop to distribute among the patients, which made me popular with people who barely knew me. 

I did not spend those last moments of the pitiful year that had been 2007 with anyone. 

During that time, I had been psychotic the majority of the days, had relapsed on alcohol and drugs after five years of diligent abstinence. I did not bother sifting through my memories to find something worth remembering. My year had been cat litter. All that it could shake out, all that it knew was shit.

So I stayed in my room, away from the patients drinking my colas, and used my computer. 

A few weeks before, I found a great way to kill time on the old machine: I got my hands on a few different recording programs, and using them, I could lose myself for hours. Soon it seemed as though the days and nights were all just background noise, and the music I had recorded was the only real sound there was. 

There is no hope for someone new to recording to record well consistently. I had been making my own tracks for almost four years at that point, but a great many of them could not be used. This was largely due to my inexperience as a producer rather than my ineptitude as a songwriter. 

So out of hundreds of songs, I whittled away until I had only sixty-nine that were reasonable inclusions on a b-sides record at least. 

Going through these captured moments, I could forget that anything existed but that music. Sometimes I did not even feel locked into Spinks. Art freed my heart.

There I would sit, tweaking audio all night, my phone next to me and buzzing every so often with messages from Pamela. She worked the third shift, and I was having trouble sleeping, so we stayed in touch often over the phone. 

The same could not be said for our many canceled rendezvous. 

Perhaps a half-dozen times, we were supposed to meet up and make music again, and we had not been able to do so. Much of this could have been due to the constraints of my nine PM curfew, but there were other times where that was not the issue, and increasingly I felt a distance from her emotions even as she went on about how badly she wanted to work together. 

I wanted to be together with her, too. It did not become clear that we were not to be until we had met perhaps twice as I headed in January. 

At that second meeting, she told me that the reason she had been blowing me off was because she had just fallen in love. She and her new man had been inseparable for their first week, and she had had no time until the moment we were in for anything else. 

This part, I believe I handled well. 

I listened to her biased description of him, as every lover does not know respective lovers. There is madness, delusion surely, in infatuation, mutual in her case or solitary in mine. The false is believed. I was willing to let her stay insane and continue the project regardless of my disappointment. 

I had been rejected or denied by women before and had been able to continue working with them. I saw no reason that such an arrangement could not be made given our professional chemistry. 

After all, the work we were doing showed some promise, and I wanted to see where it could take us.  

The more she sang for me, however, the more limitations I realized that she had as a vocalist. Even when drunk, as she had been on Christmas Eve, she was nervous to the point where I had to coax notes out of her throat with a continuous assurance that she sounded good. Sometimes she did not, and I could tell she could tell I was lying.  

I was still under the impression that when working with someone, I could not expect anyone to be accurate in gauging a level of interest in whatever creativity such folks had. 

The good ones did not know they were good. The bad ones thought they were great. I still don’t know where that leaves me.

So it was that I could tell Pamela how she was doing, and she had no frame of reference to gauge how to improve her situation. She did not know when she was doing well, and so could not repeat any successful experiments and get the same results. She just did not know enough to be that effective. 

I figured that if we worked together for some years, the two of us would get to the point of accurate self-appraisal. That moment nevertheless felt very distant.

I had plenty of appraising to do with respect to the sixty-nine songs that I wanted to release digitally and sell as a group for only a few dollars. Unfortunately, Apple would let nothing so discounted fly through their iTunes ring, and that was where I would likely sell the most. 

In those days, I believed I would sell a great many records and songs, largely because I had never released on any. 

I had to hit up a close friend for the money to register the songs on a site for posting them to web stores, but I never even bothered to send the tracks in. The way it worked out, all I could afford to do considering my limited freedom was to find a dozen or so tracks and press a hundred copies of a single album. 

For as much as I wanted to make my first release epic in scope, it simply was not practical to make it so. 

Consequentially, I had less work to do on nights like New Year’s Eve – I only had to tweak the recordings of a single album’s worth of tracks. 

Each one still took days. Countless times I burned CDs and ran around Spinks popping the test discs in three or four different CD players trying to find the right balance of sound. The recordings that had made the final cut had been recorded over the span of four years and with widely varying quality of gear. 

The earliest pieces I had done were almost whisper soft and had to be brought up to match the volume of the fancier work that had been done more recently, and it had to be brought up in such a way that it did not sound with too many hisses. 

This process, my broke-ass mastering, had a significant upside. 

For one, it made me feel as though there was something I could do when I got out, that music was still in my future and hopefully someday enough to at least help support me. Also, I was building valuable skills that would come into their own sense of importance with future recordings as well. And, of course, it made the days go faster.

The nights were more likely to go slow. 

Pamela was still texting me all night long, and I was still engaging her when she did, a move that deprived me of more sleep than even Lester had with his terrifying psychosis. Somehow love, unrequited or not, had energized me more than even fear could have. 

I had hope for the future. Pamela and I had, since the night at the Christmas party, spent long stretches talk about where we wanted to move. 

I still was holding out for a large lump-sum payment from my mental disability claim when it finally came through. With this money, I held fast to the idea that I would be healthiest if I moved far away from Roosevelt. The attitude that made life so difficult in my hometown – its anger, its shoulder chips, its despair – was largely a matter of my own attitude projected onto everyone around me. 

Plenty could be accomplished in a place where many despaired of ever accomplishing anything. 

Clearly, the work I had been doing on my own music made plain how democratic the recording process had become, so I was able to accomplish important tasks concerning a musical career that would not have been possible only a few years before. 

The newness of the world was treating me well; it was the oldness of it that I could not master, the oldest effort of the old themselves, the future of it exactly the same as the past: lust and trust and the rest. All united into one overused word: love. 

No amount of digital or artistic wizardry would spell out new terms to my relationship with a new friend whose friendship was a disappointment at best. 

Pamela kept missing times to play, and when we finally did meet up, she asked me to move to San Francisco with her and her boyfriend. I let it roll for a while as far as how the emotions of such obvious defeat. 

I was upset with her, and it did not take me long to tell her to leave. 

Devin and I had already been in talks about how to settle the relationship, sever it and stitch it up for closure. I had a reason, and I took it. I slept that night with the ringer off and let the trickling of petering out text messages to flow down to nothing, to peace.

## Chapter 18

I met Roger the first time that I was in Spinks, three months before my thoughts turned homicidal. 

At once, Spinks had been repulsive to me. I felt worse about it than I had about any of the several places where I had been put during difficult times for my mind. 

People like Roger were one of the prime reasons. 

So many of those in there were desperate and despairing that there would never have been time for me to listen to them all. The only reason I ended up listening to Roger was because, from the start, he pursued me. When I was about to get out of my first stay, I had never been more ready to leave a residential situation. 

Somehow Roger found out that I was about to leave and picked at this happiness until it got much, much worse. 

Over and over, he asked for my number, or address, or any way to contact me. 

I had by that point been through the wringer of Alcoholics Anonymous phone calls. The Satanist Redd was the worst. Because of all that, I can preternaturally sense when someone so needs attention that any information will be followed with the rapid-fire of call after call after call. 

I was in no shape or made to take such well-intentioned harassment, and so I denied Roger the phone. 

Then he asked and asked and asked some more, and to get a few minutes peace during the last bit I was spending in that awful place, I gave him one of my email addresses and told him I would be willing to write but nothing more. He took this with excited, almost agitated joy, as if he were so full of energy that his arms could buzz like those of a hummingbird. 

I was further disturbed by this excitement. 

There was a time only a year or so before that a friend in AA had gone from a frequent caller to an assaulting harasser. I could just feel the violence in Roger. So I did everything I could to forget about him. 

All I allowed myself to remember of him was a strange, idiotically basic song he played over and over on the guitar that he brought with himself everywhere. The song was about his passion for eating chicken. I will give him this much – at least it was unlike most songs I had heard. 

It was ridiculous but pure, a personal expression of his very basic hunger, using chicken as a metaphor for the sustenance we all need, and then we would all laugh at such considerations.

All that changed in Early January of 2008. 

I decided to walk to my brother's new place, about a mile from Spinks with a few landmarks and statues along the way. I had barely passed the library and into the ornaments of Dover Park when I saw him. I saw the Chicken song guy. 

I had forgotten his name and only remembered the first few lines of his novelty piece. 

Still, those lines and the baby's song of a simple melody ran through my head as soon as I saw him. 

I was terrified and engaged at once: terrified because I knew the chance for another harassing madman was very high, and that I would likely have to deal with the Chicken Song guy quite a bit after such a rendezvous; and engaged because I could tell he was in dire shape.

When he saw me, he seemed to straighten his posture and gave me something of what was supposed to be a smile but was instead too forced to be anything of the kind.

Regardless, he thought he should be happy to find a peer, even if he could not be happy in his current state.   He just could not make himself display that happiness as hard as he was trying. 

I appreciated the failed effort more perhaps than I would have appreciated genuine joy. 

His struggle was plain, and his delusions were gone, and he knew how sad the world could be and could not do enough to forget that. He was a frozen mess, spittle on metal hardening in seconds, that disgusting and that cold. I had no choice but to approach in spite of everything but decency. 

The devil had not taken that away.

When I reached him, I saw the blue on his lips and the frost burn on his nose and the two fingers that broke through holey gloves. Frostbite was likely. Hypothermia seemed only an hour or so away. He did not have to tell me that he was homeless during the worst time of winter. That was plain as his solid blue jacket. 

I wondered if there were a particular reason that he had been turned away from every potential shelter in the town. 

He made clear that the only shelter there was demanded attendance of Christian services, sermons, prayer meetings, and the like for several hours a day. 

If these are missed, the homeless man or woman in question would be turned out to die, as Roger was. It was Christ or death that time of year, and Roger had chosen death. 

The young man, barely twenty, already believed his life was at an end and chose to be expelled so that he could die of natural causes and still make it into the peace and joy of the Heaven he was hoping for then. 

He would be a martyr, a forgotten one, like the freezing homeless who dot the corners where drugs and sex are sold, sometimes upright and hot for trouble, sometimes horizontal, cold, and dead. 

Freezing to death is one way of minimizing the pain of ending life early, as it comes with warmth and a sense of well being not found in other forms of suicide. Despite his apparent death wish, I also sensed some life in him, if only because he had all his things, including his boxy cheap acoustic guitar. Some part of him still wanted to play.

I asked him how he got homeless and in need of the mission, and he went on about his frequent alcohol and drug abuse, as he had during those first few days we had spent together the summer before. 

In a drunken state, he had thrown a few men around with his fullback body, and they had been injured in the play. 

With seventeen previous felony assault convictions, he knew that unless he fled the scene, which happened to be his own apartment, that he would be caught and put through even further consequences. In running to escape, he had only trapped himself without a place to go at the worst possible time. None of it would have happened, he finished, if it had not been for alcohol.

As it happened, I was on my way to an AA meeting in a few hours or so, and so I asked if he had a desire to stop drinking. Finding out that he had that, and had it strongly, I offered to take him to the AA meeting I was about to attend. 

Having been in more sessions of group therapy for his mental illness, schizoaffective disorder, the idea of sitting in a room with a bunch of nuts going on about philosophy and theology, and the blight or brightness of their present experience sounded comfortable.

So, after walking the blocks a few times to keep each warm, the two of us found our ride and headed out of downtown and deep into the suburbs. 

The woman who took us was a middle-aged caretaker who reminded me of my mother, only perhaps more Christian than she had become. Being that natural mother, the woman was happy to handle Roger even as he shifted his eyes in jerks and generally talked and moved like the film cliché of a killer. 

He told her about his seventeen felony assault convictions, and she took it in stride, asking him how many of them were alcohol-related. His answer came quick. It was clear that aside from assaulting a few people who had abused him first, every occasion had happened when Roger was drunk.

The caretaker and I reassured him that he would soon be in a better place than even a therapist for someone with his problems. We parked her car and walked into the basement of the club that I attended most frequently. No sooner did Roger sit down than did he ask the caretaker if she would like to hear the Chicken Song. 

After an enthusiastic yes, he began softly knocking his fingernails against the gummy strings. 

The caretaker loved it, and I smiled. I had never noticed a few of the clever phrase turns in the lyrics. 

I was starting to realize that Roger was not stupid, but with this realization came even more fear. 

And there was still the problem of finding a bed for a twisted felon, because I had no place to house him. Everyone I spoke with said they had no way to take care of him. The AA club was wrapping up the midday meeting, and it would be several hours before either of us had anything to do again. 

The aftermath of Roger left me banned from my home for the umpteenth time. Apparently, my mother did not like it when I brought home creepy lunatics from off the street. I did not want to bring him home. Initially, I had taken steps to keep that from happening. 

I told him he could stay at the AA club until someone who could give him a ride came along. I knew he had nowhere to go, but I had nowhere else to put him that was warm enough to avoid hypothermia, so he stayed at the club when I left and was taken to my parent’s house. 

There were leftovers from a fancy dinner a few nights before, and I made a plate of them and was halfway through it when I heard a knock.

I answered the door and let a strange, homely woman in. 

She seemed to be a friend of my parents, and know who I was, though I didn’t know her. The woman told me there was a fat, red-haired lunatic meandering across Tree Line Road and back again, stumbling along the path of a sine wave. 

To all who stopped, he was saying my name and only my name. 

Eventually, someone who knew who I was showed up, but not before the cops did. The police were holding him aside, giving him the business, and still, he was only saying my name. She said she said what she said to warn me that there might be a lunatic out to get me, and she thought I should take proper precautions. 

When I told her that he was a friend and a sick one, she softened a bit but still seemed to rattle like a snake. There was fear in her, a great deal of it, and I was in no position to ask what I was about to ask, but I asked it anyway. 

“Will you take me to him?” 

I saw her eyes shoot back to the van parked at the bottom of the front yard’s incline. Through that, I saw shapes move in the back of that van and understood that the children involved would likely not want to be around someone as creepy as I was, let alone someone who felt like a monster inside a hatching egg. 

This mom would be putting two loonies in her car if she went along with me. 

The whole situation hinged on her decision. Roger, with his temper and record, was sure to snap if prodded long enough. I had to get there before he lost it on yet another victim.

The woman said she would go get him if I could assure her that he was safe. 

This I could not say and tell the truth. But if I were not to lie, Roger could end up in terrible trouble yet again. So I lied, and we went for him. Traffic was backed up on either side of the police car blocking all flow. 

At the back of the jam I got out and walked up to where Roger and the police officer were discussing me. Or, rather, Roger kept repeating my name, and the officer kept asking him whether or not he was on drugs. Neither was making any progress until I got there.

I stepped up to the pair who were arguing without changing their words. 

I sought out the officer’s position, discovered his concern that Roger was on a great many drugs. This was true, of course, but utterly false in the way it that the officer meant it. Roger and I were both on several psychotropic medications for our respective mental illnesses, but neither of us had taken any street drugs recently. 

I quickly explained this much to the cop. He was an ancient man who moved in darting shifts, as if he were a flyweight boxer about fifty years younger than he looked. He smiled, and the wrinkles above his lips marked the dentures beneath him. He looked as though he had seen an awful lot in his decades on the beat and could judge a threat when he saw one.

He asked what that drugs were for specifically and what their brand names were. 

I rattled off the list. 

I told him that the two of us were both schizophrenic and that we had gotten separated on the way to my parents’ house. 

Once we were back there, the trouble would be over.  He offered us a ride there, and we were on our way. Traffic began to flow again, we passed the soccer van and waved them off from the back window. 

The two of us being back there would be easier for everyone, or at least I thought it would be easy for everyone who was not in that house. I had not called in advance and was essentially popping in. It being a close relative’s home, I did not think this would be a problem, even with a huge creepy redhead in tow.

When I walked in, I found my tepid plate still on the counter from the hour before and began to eat it. I asked Roger when he had last eaten.

He told me it had been two days, so I made him a high plate of leftovers and passed them on to him. Roger ate fast, shoveling the food into his mouth from a distance of only an inch or two. He then drank several glasses of water and asked about dessert.  

Before we got to that, I heard the garage door open. My mother was arriving. She walked in with a few purchases under her arms and stopped short when she saw Roger. 

Always an intuitive person, she sensed right away that Roger was dangerous, or at least could be. Right away, she pulled me aside and asked me where she could take us that was not there. I told her that Roger was new to AA and that we could go back to the club. 

She took us there without a further word.

There had been a time when everyone associated with AA was a trustworthy person to my parents, and I could bring home whomever I wanted as long as they were in recovery. 

That all changed when Redd, the Satanist I met in the program, had threatened to kill my whole family and me over and over on the phone. He had been to our house, and I was constantly afraid that he would use this knowledge. So, program people had become just as dangerous as someone I might bring in from a mental hospital. Roger was both and thus could not be trusted.

It took only a moment for her to scold me. 

The vibe she had gotten off of my friend had been enough to terrify her. Ever since Redd had threatened my whole family, my mother did not trust strangers. I had little reason to argue with her;  I’d threatened her myself. 

Clearly, Roger had disturbed her. She was yelling at me for my recklessness and the dangerous imposition such a sick man presented to the whole family. I was not to come home with anyone without direct permission. I was not even to come myself without direct permission. 

I was truly exiled.

Roger and I just messed around and talked to waste time until the meeting started. It was only late afternoon, and it took several hours for anyone else to get there. So we just drank coffee, and I smoked cigarettes, and we talked, and we played a bit of guitar. Roger did not smoke, was socially awkward, and was pretty terrible at the guitar, but he had fun watching me do many of those things. We found our ways to get by.

Roger’s second meeting went smoothly but he nodded in and out throughout it, obviously exhausted from walking miles and miles in search of me. I got something out of that one, I remember, though I do not remember how much or what, only that it was good. 

I do not like to repeat even the ideas presented at meetings. It goes against the anonymous part of AA, which is really half of its use just as it is half of its name. I will admit that I shared about Roger’s homelessness, asking for a couch he could stay on if only for a night or anything that might keep him from freezing to death. I got no responses whatsoever in the meeting, and no one came up to me after it. 

I had to ask someone, so I asked Craig.

I asked Craig because he was an atheist and would understand why Roger would not go to church just to have a place to sleep. After I explained the situation, Craig said he wanted to help but only had a two-seat truck, so someone would have to ride in the back. I offered to do just that even though a blizzard was blowing in off the Lake. 

We wheeled off, and I stood in the back of that truck and felt the sting and slap of sharp wind and the flow around me from moving fast. The pain filled me with excitement, that kind that only comes from an injury that turns one toward fighting or fleeing. 

Our first destination was the very mission Roger had been discharged from. They turned him away within a second. 

The cold was really biting into us by then – it was painful to breathe, for instance, so the two giant lunatics squished into one bucket seat somehow.  

Crammed and forging on, we realized there was nowhere else to go. So we drove around a few blocks and looked at the snow turning beams of street lamps into orange cones and watching the grand now abandoned houses of the downtown sleep forever under the piling cold.

At last another option occurred to Roger – sanctuary with the Catholics. He had worn out his welcome with the protestants, but there was another sanctuary. So we found a rectory he had heard about, one that took in folks with nowhere else to go. After they let him in, he hurried inside without even looking back, without waving, and I knew somehow that he would be looking me up again. One way or another, I had a new charge. This made me feel better somehow, useful that someone could want help from someone as messed up as I was then.

“The lack of secular shelters makes me sick,” Craig said. 

For those with nowhere to sleep on a bitter night in Roosevelt, it was God or death. Unhoused people who did choose death were sometimes spared, but on the coldest nights, some who would not believe did not live.

When Craig and I got to Spinks, he shouted, “God save us from the Christians.”

Then we laughed, and I could almost feel God’s overripe world between my thumb and forefinger as it rotted on a vine.

## Chapter 19

At last, I was given word that Beatrice had triumphed in her relentless quest to get me Social Security Disability - with a consequential catch.

Though the 1,200 pages of therapy notes documenting my condition had carried the day, I was told that I was to receive no back pay. I was deemed to not have been disabled at any point up until the determination that I was disabled. The evidence of my problems in the past did not indicate that I had any problems in the past, but it did indicate the my problems came into existence instantly once disability was approved. By the time of my approval, however, susch absurdity had become the guiding force of my life, so I celebrated. I had been given a $700 a month stipend, after all. 

Beatrice had never heard of this outcome, it made no sense, but anything was better than denial. 

At the time, the lack of back pay seemed like the final kick in the ribs as I coughed up blood on the snow. I knew then that I was in the home stretch of my stay in Spinks, but I wasn’t going to leave town bankrolled by my misfortune. Without a lump sum to relocate, I had to find a way to make Roosevelt, and my own brain, work with what was in front of me.

One fact became clear during my confinement: I have been blessed with more insight than most who are as delusional as I can be. 

My onetime roommate Lester was not as fortunate as I was. 

In late 2007, Lester had painted the walls of our bathroom with instant coffee as he screamed in the shower for hours. Then, after I described his behavior to the staff, he was sent to a more closely monitored facility. 

In early February, Lester came back. 

I feared he might hate me, but he didn’t seem to remember me at all. Though he appeared to have reached a vantage point closer to an acceptable persepctive on life, I did not know what he was doing behind closed doors anymore. His mindstate was not as discernable now that we weren’t together all night, but such ignorance was a blessing for me.

Lester was then wearing headphones connected to a pocket radio that played continuously in his ears. Music can stave off voices for me, and I hoped that his tunes were soothing him. He did seem to have been relieved of a burden of his own since our time as roommates.

As soon as the headphones were off, he went back into the old routine, however.

“You know. You do. You know I know.” 

Having been tortured without violence by this man when all I needed were peace and rest, I got short with him. 

“Know what? What do I know?” I asked Lester.

“You know, I know you killed them.”

“Who?”

“Mother. Father. I killed them. You killed them. You know why.”

“Why?”

Throughout my life, that messiah complex has hammered spiritual nails into the soles of my feet and the palms of my hands. That much has been established. 

Still, I had never been beside someone suffering likewise, someone who completely believed that he was God himself as I did. I could not feel my own skin crawl when I was the one making insane claims, the kind that have convinced believers to commit suicide or homicide. I did feel like I was shedding my gooseflesh as I listened to Lester, however. 

I hope to never again hear someone say and believe what Lester said and believed then. 

He said, “You know I’m God. I’m God.”

“If you’re God,” I asked, “who am I?”

“You’re just a human being.”

The emotional impact of an epiphany is easier to summon in the future when I store that feeling along with its experiential context. That is why, in the moments when my life changes most, I take inventory of my surroundings. 

Lester’s headphones made the only sound, a softly thumped backbeat of country guitar strums. I could smell him three feet away: ashes, sweat, and farts. Globs of snowflakes were spackling our faces with brushstrokes cold and damp. Above, orange cones beamed from the courtyard’s overhead lamps, their rays illuminated like laser beams through smoke

I saw myself, and I never wanted to be whom I’d seen again.

The day after my encounter in the courtyard, I prayed to God to not hear any more voices, including God’s. That night in the courtyard and my spiritual response to the incident was what granted reprieve from my messiah complex. I still needed meds and talk therapy and peer support and absitence from addictive substances, but I did not get well until I got right. Only God could convince me that I was not God.

Spirituality was the missing piece that let me complete the puzzle of a fragmented, scattered mind. There were no changes made to my medication regimen, and yet I became dramatically saner. My delusions had been spiritual in nature, and perhaps that is why addressing my psychosis through spiritual growth as well as medical care healed me more than continuing medication and treatment without a spiritual practice.

Once prayer worked, I began to start and end the day with a devotional. Immediately I got results. My white light moment was asking to see no more white lights.

This disgusts me on some level. I feel it makes my life into just another damn story of conversion and redemption and salvation through Jesus Christ and all kinds of other religious processes that I feel belittle the true connection I had to develop. 

As a matter of fact that I find myself apologizing for, I do believe that Jesus Christ is my personal lord and savior. But this is nothing new; I had believed as much when I was wringing comfort out of the Gideon copy of Psalms I found in the drawer of my nightstand in the Unit. 

Faith was not enough, though, not even close. If anything, naked faith made me worse, led me away from good faith, was bad faith, and almost killed me. By “naked faith,” I mean taking the supposed messages I was getting from God and the Dark Lord and thinking I was at all equipped to parse them into something intelligible. 

No, it was not until I rooted my belief system in a routine of penitence, going so far as to genuflect twice daily, that I got anywhere at all with God.

What I prayed for is painfully ironic, at least to me. I asked God, in effect, to remain silent. I do not feel absence in his muteness, however. 

I justify the existence of God in a narcissistic way – he is there for me because I need him, and now I am just another of his fatalistic clichéd puppets using limbs he moves to write treatises on free will. I have written such treatises, piles of them, to no end, to no end at all. 

I still cannot choose when the Dark Lord tortures me.

Prayer works but not always so. I have met so many people who professed profound faith that I will never have, and yet they did not seem to be getting the same results that I was getting out of the God idea. 

I have long thought of God in terms of thermodynamics. Chaos is the direction everything goes if no energy is put into ordering it. If enough energy is expended, order can arise from chaos, a mind can organize itself that was once disorganized, but I do not believe a person can find that much energy without contributions of energy from other  people.

## Chapter 20

Lester was not the only one to come back. Many of the real characters I met during those months observed seemed drawn back to such observation. 

Jennifer returned in February. She brought back the old puns, shouting, “Sock you, mother socker!” and, “sock off!” and swearing, as was clear to me, that her IQ was far higher than the score she had been told: eighty. The sock was still tied around her heart.

Jennifer seemed to have as much resistance to her dietary restrictions as she had to her medications, if not more. Like many who had been on meds long-term, Jennifer had diabetes. 

I understood why. I craved sugar when I was on any of the meds I had been put on for psychosis. In Brinks, I would find myself in the kitchen in the middle of the night, eating piece after piece of thin toast and mixed fruit jelly, in a trance that did not end until after I had consumed a thousand calories. 

For her part, Jennifer was defiant about her diet, ever demanding fruit juice, ramen noodles, and anything containing refined sugar. More than once, I saw toast be pried from her grasp during our time together in the Unit. But in Spinks, there was not that kind of medical attention, so the unfortunate girl endangered herself frequently. 

I say girl when, in fact, Jennifer was well over thirty. She had another condition that kept her appearing childlike. 

Jennifer had a habit of listing these conditions. “I have bipolar, schizophrenia, borderline, congestive heart failure, diabetes, kidney problems, and emphysema.” She counted them on short, thick fingers as she spoke, smoking in the snow.

My crush, green-eyed, redheaded Sarah, also returned to Spinks in February. Her long hair had been cut into a bob and did not suit her, but I said nothing about her worsened appearance. Instead, I asked her how she had been. 

Three suicide attempts and bounces from hospital to hospital to no effect, she told me.. “This time, I think I’ve turned a corner, though.” 

Even as I smiled, I shook my head, knowing that corners never get turned without other corners appearing. 

When I last saw Sarah, I told her of Jennifer and the Sock Rebellion, and she remonstrated with me for disrespecting those in authority. At that point, she had never been in the Unit. When I saw her again, this had changed, and so had her insight into the havoc I had incited. 

“I’m glad you gave them hell,” she said. “Most of the time, they never get what they give.”

During my reunion with Sarah, I was given word where I was moving. 

My dreams of a Palm Sunday in New York City had already been dashed by my lack of disability back pay. I was returning instead to the place where my living damnation began: the Manor.

My team of caretakers had agreed that my brother was a healthy enough custodian for me to be released. No one was worried about Chuck’s safety in my presence. I had finally gotten disability and could pay rent. After months of struggle, steady income was all it took to spring me in a few days.

That meant going back to live where I’d become possessed and relapsed.

Yet, eighteen months after my confrontation with Redd, that minion of the Pontiac chapter of the Satan’s Army gang, I felt nostalgia for the day his handgun had been aimed at me. Back then, I could laugh that he’d said he cast a spell to put the Devil in me.

When I left Spinks, those two women who had known my demons were beside me. I hugged them both goodbye. Jennifer was thrilled, shaking. With Sarah, such passion was not there. There was a new distance, and I felt sure that it would mean little if I ever saw her again.

As the glass doors of Spinks closed behind me, a voice other than the Dark Lord came, not Christ, not Mary, not madness, but a guttural accent, Hungarian, a memory returning like a song stuck in my head, not a demon in my soul. For a reason only God knows, I remembered the past advice of Fred the smoking social worker from Spinks. 

“Get over it; grow up; get a job: that’s life. It is what it is. Get used to it.” 

As Fred’s words faded, I felt better. 

I threw my guitar case and garbage bags full of fine clothing into my brother’s truck bed and lit a peach cigar. I climbed into the cab, and we left Spinks under snowfall. 

Riding shotgun, window down, winter wind snapping my face, I smoked free air as the radio played on the short drive to Houndstooth Manor.

## Chapter 21

Behind the Manor, built thirteen decades after the house itself, is a three-hundred square foot deck. 

Its pale planks, splintering on their edges, hadn’t ever been refinished. With no egress to the backyard, the deck was just a massive balcony overlooking an iron gate, a wide alley, and the backdoor to John’s Bar, where I sat beside Chuck three days after Spinks. 

No food was served at John’s, not even pretzels. There was no pool table, dart board, or pinball machine. There were no bands playing, no karaoke nights, and not a single TV. The only things to do there were drink and listen to the jukebox. This jukebox had just been upgraded from CDs to streaming, however, making it more expensive and difficult to use. Patrons no longer tried to control the music, saving their willpower for the alcohol and the drive home.

So, the songs repeated.

Chuck and I didn’t have to worry about driving. We only had to cross the alley, open the gate, and we were back to the Manor. 

I already knew Chuck invited me to walk down to John’s with him because he wanted to have a talk, but neither of us seemed to want to be there. We sat on stools regardless, exchanging mediocre jokes, as he drank his one-dollar pint slowly, and I drank my can of Coke quickly. Finally, I got real.

“What are we here to talk about?” I asked.

“There’s a house show at the Manor this weekend. Not yours.”

I sighed. 

“I know. I wasn’t invited to play a show in my own house. Sorry, I mean the house where I can’t even afford to live and will soon be exiled from to that disabled housing project across from the courthouse.”

Two men were laughing at the other end of the bar, and paranoia kicked in. 

I felt like they recognized me, knew my story, knew that I still thought I was the messiah, just as I still do, when I wake in the night from half-dreams of false destiny. 

Maybe they knew me from the House of Lords or the House of Commons and had relapsed together. I studied their faces, but I didn’t recognize them, they wanted nothing from me, and I felt foolish in a way I had for months. Too few cared enough about me to care that I had delusions beyond grandeur, and that made me feel humbled. 

Chuck took a deep breath in. I lit a peach cigar as he was still inhaling and the odor seemed to make him cough. 

“You know, Steve is playing,” he said. “You guys hate each other or something. Are you going to be cool about it?”

Steve, who had once been my best friend before becoming my nemesis, was outdoing me in what I wanted to do most: becoming a well-regarded musician. 

The goal was no longer to be a rockstar. I wanted the respect of a scene that had forever after written me off as too crazy for music, an idea I now find crazy in itself, all our histories now considered. Yet Steve, or rather my rabid, viral attacks against him on MySpace, convinced our scene for all time that I was dangerous to others, Steve among them.

“I will be the most chilled out guy there,” I said. “The last seven months made sure of that.”

I was dead serious. 

My psychiatrist had gone through those stacks of medical records to determine exactly which medications I needed to take, medications I still take. My therapist had been chipping away at the Bat Armor of my delusions, gauntlets I cast aside like the weight of Annie. My sponsor had become the first person in my life with who I could tell anything without fear of any judgment, until I found my wife. Psychically, emotionally, and spiritually I had never been a place of more strength, even as I had never felt more broken. 

I knew the treatment for my messiah complex had worked miraculously. I no longer needed to believe that miracles happened as a result of me. 

I was starting, just starting, to realize that my recovery was the opposite of grace – it was what I deserved for living a decent life. Recovery is justice.

“I know you probably want to play too,” Chuck said. “So I asked Brad, and he said you could do a song if you want.”

I sucked air through my teeth as it clenched my thin peach cigar. 

I had written thrity times more songs than Steve, and I was being offered five minutes in a three-hour show celebrating a record label I founded. 

The only indignity worse was that I would gladly take that time because I had so little else to look forward to with the continuing order of treatment, coupled with zero back pay from Social Security, chaining me like the Atlas of Roosevelt. Chuck could probably sense how insulting I found the situation and didn’t seem surprised when I raised the volume of my voice threefold.

“You don’t know what it’s like to grow up in a musical shadow. ‘Chuck has perfect pitch.’ ‘Chuck can learn anything by ear.’”

“My shadow? My shadow! I have lived in your shadow since you started reading at two. Listen, you dick, I was going to ask if you wanted to play together, for me to play with you.”

Chuck had finished his beer and started another. My Coke was long gone. The air felt like walking through the lightest lager ever made. I could feel myself getting tipsy just breathing. I wanted to leave, but Chuck wanted to talk, and we weren’t done talking.

“Don’t go to Mom and Dad anymore if you need something,” he said, resting his massive hand on my nearby shoulder. “They’re not old but they’re too old for this shit. You need something, you come to me.”

The computerized jukebox lurched into silence as it downloaded its next randomized classic rock staple. 

In the quiet, I stood up, and the stool beneath me peeled and crackled in its stickiness, like tape pulled from skin. Then, slick guitars crunched in, and I could barely hear myself as I spoke. The words came through me, unbidden as they had when I was reading minds as a false god. 

I said, “When do we start practicing?”

Chuck stood beside me then and shook my hand as if a deal had been made. Then he drained his beer, and we left a few singles on the bar, tipping generously.

I left John’s with relief, not from escaping the first bar where I’d drank after five years of continuous sobriety, but because I hadn’t made anything worse with words. My only goal had been not to lose it on my family yet again, and more than that had happened. I don’t know that I will ever again feel closer to my brother as I did that night. 

Everything wasn’t all right, but I was going to be all right. 

Chuck had always wanted to protect me, going back to the bullies he beat bloody on the playground because they had picked on me. For seven months, that had been impossible for him, as I faced dangerous person after dangerous person. Now I was living with him, and he could make sure nobody would grift me or hit me. As crazy as it got at any of his parties, he wasn’t going to keep me up all night screaming about how he killed his father too in the bathroom and doodling on the walls with instant coffee. 

I was safer with him even in a drunken crowd.

As we closed the gate to the Manor’s iron back gate behind us, its latch clanged in place and that sounded like music. 

We went in through a side door, and I unlocked it. I could lock it if I wanted. I had a key to get back in if I left. Keys take on new significance when you have been locked up for months, knowing that you again control access to life and safety, not someone else. I wasn’t free, but I was freer.

Chuck and I could be as loud as we wanted in the Manor, even late at night, so we found a basement room and began to rehearse."
